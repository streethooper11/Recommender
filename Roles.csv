Seth MacFarlane,
Seth MacFarlane,"MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).[15] During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry,[15] which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company.[16] Then in 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry & Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons.[15] Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters.[17] Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.[18] Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts.[19] While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.[17][20] MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that ""Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl.""[19]"
Lawrence,"Morpheus (/ˈmɔːrfiəs/) is a fictional character in The Matrix franchise.[2] He is portrayed by Laurence Fishburne in the first three films, and in the video game The Matrix: Path of Neo, where he was the only original actor to reprise his character's voice.[3] In The Matrix Resurrections, an AI program based on him is portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.[1][4][5]"
Lawrence,"In the Matrix films, Morpheus is the captain of the Nebuchadnezzar, which is a hovercraft of the human forces of the last human city, Zion, in a devastated world where most humans are grown by sentient machines to be used as power sources and their minds kept imprisoned in the Matrix, a virtual computer-generated world, to stop them from realising the truth of the real world. Morpheus was once a human living inside the Matrix until he was freed.[9]"
Lawrence,"In The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, Morpheus was known to be a truly inspirational leader and influential teacher to many people, particularly the majority of his crew, to the extent that Tank commented that ""Morpheus was a father to them, as well as a leader"". In The Matrix Revolutions, with Morpheus's faith in the prophecy shattered, he does not appear as strong a leader or character as he was in the first two films, he comes across as subdued and defeated. Despite his strong faith, Morpheus still showed some rationality in dangerous situations rather than blindly relying on his beliefs to see him through the current crisis; perhaps his only truly irrational decision was to attack Agent Smith while unarmed in order to give Neo a chance to escape."
