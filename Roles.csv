Seth MacFarlane,
Seth MacFarlane,"MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).[15] During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry,[15] which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company.[16] Then in 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry & Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons.[15] Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters.[17] Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.[18] Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts.[19] While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.[17][20] MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that ""Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl.""[19]"
