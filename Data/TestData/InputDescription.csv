Jack Black,"Shelly Oberon's background before coming to ""JUMANJI"" with his three companions is unknown, but he is described as a genius and code-breaker, and has qualifications in archeology and paleontology. He is also an expert in geometry, which is very useful for finding the proper way across hazardous and unreliable walkways."
Chris Evans,"Buzz, like many characters in Toy Story, is a complicated one, who feels genuine emotions such as pride, anger, depression, and sadness, much like a regular human. These are traits that he shares with his best friend, Woody, however, one could say that Buzz is better at keeping his emotions in check than the cowboy. Buzz is known for his bravery and courage with a by the book mindset, believing the way people should live their life by following the rules. Though there are rare moments when he will bend the rules or tell a cover story if needed to when he knows it is the right thing to do. Though possessing great leadership qualities, one of Buzz's biggest character flaws at times is that he can be rather unemotional."
