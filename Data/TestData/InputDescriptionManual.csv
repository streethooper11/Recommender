Jack Black,"Shelly Oberon's background before coming to ""JUMANJI"" with his three companions is unknown, but he is described as a genius and code-breaker, and has qualifications in archeology and paleontology. He is also an expert in geometry, which is very useful for finding the proper way across hazardous and unreliable walkways."
Chris Evans,"Buzz, like many characters in Toy Story, is a complicated one, who feels genuine emotions such as pride, anger, depression, and sadness, much like a regular human. These are traits that he shares with his best friend, Woody, however, one could say that Buzz is better at keeping his emotions in check than the cowboy. Buzz is known for his bravery and courage with a by the book mindset, believing the way people should live their life by following the rules. Though there are rare moments when he will bend the rules or tell a cover story if needed to when he knows it is the right thing to do. Though possessing great leadership qualities, one of Buzz's biggest character flaws at times is that he can be rather unemotional."
Keanu Reeves,"Neo is a quiet man, who thinks more than he speaks. He also has no problem learning how to fight and holding his own in a battle. He quickly rises to the responsibility of saving his friends when they are in danger, and he even begins to believe that he might be able to save the entire human race."
Dwayne Johnson,"Krypto is a noble, intelligent, strong, fun-loving, and friendly dog, and he never gives up. He is best friends with Kevin Whitney as well as Streaky the Supercat. When it comes to superhero deeds, he is serious, responsible and courageous. He also tends to be snarky when it comes to Ignatius's schemes or trickery."
Chris Hemsworth,"His charming and sympathetic personality could fool anyone at first, including Jeff and the rest of the inmates. However, throughout the course of the film, it becomes impossible not to see his more sinister side. When that happens, his little quirks and supposedly endearing actions only seem creepy and insincere."
