Ben Kingsley,"Originally born in captivity in the menagerie of the Rajah of Oodeypore, India, Bagheera began to pine for his freedom after he ran away with his friends. Once he was mature and strong enough he broke the lock on his cage and escaped into the jungle, where his ferocity and cunning won him the respect of all its other inhabitants, except Shere Khan the tiger (likely out of his arrogance). Bagheera revealed all this to Mowgli later. None but Mowgli ever learned that Bagheera once wore a collar and chain, explaining the cat's special insight concerning Men."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is presented as a wise figure. Level-headed and intelligent, the panther is amongst the most down-to-earth residents of the jungle. When first introduced, he is seen as a selfless and caring individual, rescuing the orphaned Mowgli, and going out of his way to ensure his safety from that moment forward. Although he cares a great deal about the man-cub, Bagheera is also easily frustrated and intolerable of tomfoolery. This would result in rather heated arguments against the two, specifically in regards to whether or not Mowgli should remain in the jungle or return to the Man Village to live amongst his own species. Bagheera's temper can occasionally blind his sense of judgment, resulting in careless behavior such as abandoning Mowgli in the jungle despite the knowing dangers that lurk. Nevertheless, he is quick to reform and repeatedly finds himself by Mowgli's side once again. He is a devoted ally and makes it a crucial objective to protect those he cares about."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is also commonly known as the foil of Baloo the bear, whom the former views as a ""stupid, jungle bum"". The two have opposite personalities, and continuously annoy one another with their need to push their own personal opinions onto each other. Nevertheless, these conflicts mostly centered around Mowgli's fate, and the two generally share a brotherly bond. Following the climax, when it appeared Baloo had met his demise, Bagheera revealed that he truly did care for the bear, and was notably embarrassed to see that Baloo had overheard his heartfelt eulogy. Once Mowgli made the decision to return to the Man Village, Bagheera and Baloo joyfully returned to their lives in the jungle, setting aside their differences and remained together as best friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Prior to his accident, Strange had a massive ego and pride that fueled his career. As a result, Strange only took on patients that he believed would help benefit his status, even refusing to heal a U.S. Army Colonel's back, albeit it was because this injury was a simple one any neurosurgeon can fix. His work was also driven by a desire to control death and time, which led him to refuse even looking into any patient he perceived to have little chance of recovery to avoid ruining his track record. However, if he also perceived the chance a patient could survive, he would help them recover even if it would not benefit his public image, showing that at his core, he does care about saving people. In addition, he seemed to prioritize his research over his physician work, as he stated his work would save thousands for years to come, whereas a physician would only save a handful of patients that they'd have to directly interact with. This, however, changed after his accident, which left Strange a broken man and constantly frustrated due to being incapable of returning to the life he knew. Upon visiting Kamar-Taj, Strange initially maintained his narrow-minded arrogance and stubbornly refused to believe that the Ancient One was telling the truth until she forcibly demonstrated astral projection and sent him across multiple dimensions to prove her point."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange has shown extreme determination and stubbornness, a useful trait in a doctor as he would never give up on his patients, even when one was called dead with a bullet in his brain. Also, Strange was able to determine the patient was still alive to successfully save him. He spent most of his remaining money in seven different surgeries to attempt to heal his hands to the point of near bankruptcy, remained outside of Kamar-Taj's front door for five hours after being initially thrown out, then spent most of his time at Kamar-Taj studying and improving his abilities, even going as far as studying while sleeping through astral projection. He even allowed himself to be violently killed by countless times by Dormammu until he gave in to his demands and later giving up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for saving Tony Stark's life when he was about to be killed by the Mad Titan, even though wanted to save the Time Stone first. Despite his determined and stubborn attitude, Strange has shown to be the voices of reason to those around him."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his training with the Ancient One, Strange gained a newfound appreciation for the natural order of things due to his studies of the Mystic Arts and became more humble. However, this was not to say he was a completely changed man; he retained a cocky attitude when dealing with people and things, as seen in how he behaved when he went to borrow books from Wong. This, coupled with his inquisitiveness and willingness to break rules, made him an odd one in Kamar-Taj and constantly an annoyance to many of his peers. However, due to this nature of his, he was also more willing to compromise and be somewhat flexible with his principles, quickly accepting that the Ancient One broke her own rules to do what was deemed necessary to protect the world, and he had to be willing to do so himself, which, when combined with his natural talent in the Mystic Arts, had the Ancient One name him as the new Master of the New York Sanctum, despite his relative lack of training and inexperience."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Having trained as a doctor, Strange is a pacifist as he tries to avoid in killing and physically harming people, as it goes against the Hippocratic oath. He was disgusted by his actions in killing Lucian Aster, stating he became a doctor to save lives, not take them. However, neither the Ancient One nor Karl Mordo was especially sympathetic towards this, with the former stating it was his towering ego and delusion that he could control death itself that made him become a doctor and the latter simply calling him a coward for not having the spine to do what has to be done. Nevertheless, Strange claimed that there were other ways to defeat their enemies, a claim he ultimately proved correct by defeating Dormammu without killing him. However, overtime, Strange has come to terms that he would have to forsaken his pacifist in killing and physically harming people in order to do what's right, but it mostly shows that he did grow a spine in order to do what needed to be done. Strange even goes to the point of not caring what happens to anyone that has mental and physical issues, as shown when he was going to allow a group of villains from different universes with their own Spider-Men to return to their universes and meet their fates instead of helping them, which goes against his nature as a doctor, although his intentions were to preserve the safety of the Multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Despite coming off as arrogant and genuinely selfish, Strange does have good intentions and is open-minded. Also, Strange shows loyalty to those he considers his allies or friends and would help them in anyway he could. Strange has even shown an emotional side, especially when it comes to those who are closes to him, as he nearly broke down after the Ancient One's death, saying goodbye to Christine Palmer, the prospect of losing his memory of Peter Parker, seeing the memory of Palmer giving him his watch and having to recall his sister's death. In addition, Strange would show a soft spot for orphaned children or teenagers, as he showed this to Spider-Man and America Chavez. However, Strange's greatest strength is his flexibility, as shown when he used the time stone to give himself and Mordo a second chance in stopping the Hong Kong Sanctum from getting destroyed by Kaecilius and letting Dormammu into their universe. Strange also willing help Thor locate Odin so he and Loki would return to Asgard, in spite of his mistrust."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"During his talk with Kaecilius, Strange began to see his own failings reflected in him and started showing signs of self-improvement, as shown when he expressed a newfound trust in Nicodemus West. Also, during his talk with the Ancient One before her death, he admitted that his fear of failure is what pushed him to be a successful neurosurgeon. In addition, Strange has confessed to his alternate self and later to another universe Christine Palmer, that the reason why he often comes off as aloof and arrogant, as well as controlling and sometimes paranoid is due to his childhood trauma of having to watch his younger sister drown because he was unable to do anything to save her. The sense of helplessness that he felt that day has developed into a need to always keep everything under control, due to his own fear of ever having to go through such trauma again. Strange also developed a fear of losing those who are closes to him. In addition, Strange seems to have a severe case of misophonia, meaning he is greatly distracted by even the slightest sound when he requires absolute focus. This was shown when he was operating on a patient and asked West to cover his watch as the ticking was distracting him, this even extended to his performing of spells, as Spider-Man's constant chattering in an attempt to make alterations to his spell distracted him and made him lose control of it and break open the multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his fear of losing those who are closes to him, Strange tries not to hurt or damage the lives of those around him, as shown when he was reluctant to tell his friends and fellow superheroes, especially Stark, the outcome against Thanos as he hoped for another way to defeat him until he realized that there wasn't and had no choice but to make sure the only victory against the mad titan would happen and how he hesitated and got emotional in going through with the spell that would make himself and the world forget Peter Parker. However, Strange has been secretly blaming himself for sacrificing Stark's life as he felt responsible for how the lives of his friends and allies got damaged because of his actions, even though his efforts saved the universe. This was shown when Strange felt at fault for Parker's identity as Spider-Man getting exposed by one of his enemies and ruining his life, which contributed to his decision to help the boy. Strange also showed remorse and sympathized with Wanda Maximoff as he feels guilty, because he gave Thanos the Time Stone, that she had to kill someone she loved to stop the mad titan, but it turned out to be for nothing, created a hex in a town, got corrupted by the Darkhold and became the Scarlet Witch. However, Strange's guilt was mostly because he had come to see Stark and Parker as his friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Although he has a good heart, Strange has shown to get easily annoyed and frustrated with everyone around him, especially his friends and allies, as he can be harsh and would lose his temper with them at times. Also, Strange has let his pride get the better of him, as he would place the blame on others instead of taking responsibility for his actions and mistakes. This is shown when Strange blamed Palmer, West and other doctors for ruining his life because he wouldn't accept the fact that the car accident was caused by his carelessness and lack of regard for his safety, and Parker for botching up the spells that was meant to help restore his secret identity as Spider-Man, even though they were both to blame for the incident. Also, Strange can sound heartless whenever he was upset and doesn't listen to reason, even when his friends or allies call him out for his behavior, as seen when he wasn't fazed when Parker told him to have a heart. However, despite his annoyances, frustration and pride, Strange does understand that those around him had good intentions and their hearts were in the right place. Also, Strange would make an honest effort in making amends for his actions and mistakes, especially if he realized how badly he messed up, hurt and pushed those he cares about away."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After taking his talk with the Ancient One to the heart, Strange showed strong selflessness, as seen during his battle with Dormammu, allowing himself to be killed over and over in order to keep Dormammu trapped in the time loop so mankind could live and let go of his fear of failure. Also, through the alternate Palmer's encouragement, Strange decided to put his other fears behind him, although he would always have his fear of losing those who are closes to him. However, despite demonstrating tremendous maturity, Strange does maintains some of his old habits such as making sarcastic comments and jokes when talking to others, similar to Iron Man and Peter Quill. He also retains his meticulous and diligence by forming a watchlist of individuals that might pose a threat to Earth, such as Loki."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange's imagination and intellect have given him a vastly flexible personality, so much so the Ancient One could never see exactly what his future would be, only possible paths he would take. Due to his inquisitiveness, Strange is easily able to adapt and teach himself light years ahead of even experienced sorcerers like Mordo and Kaecilius. Once he started to get the hang of his sorcery studies, he began to teach himself and was able to learn at an accelerated rate. Also, through his intelligence, Strange is able to imagine unorthodox solutions to problems, even when he lacked experience of using powerful magical relics. After his car crash, Strange's hands suffered from constant shaking, but it faded overtime, due to his training as a sorcerer. Strange even refused to direct magic into his body to heal his hands like Jonathan Pangborn did with his legs, presumably to be reminded of his mistakes in the past that led him to leave his old life as a neurosurgeon behind and the beginning of his new one as a sorcerer/superhero."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Shere Khan is known throughout the entire jungle as a tiger without mercy as well as being ruthless, sadistic, psychopathic, arrogant, hateful, power-hungry, and hypocritical, who mainly kills for his own pleasure instead of survival. His most defining personality trait is his unbounded hatred towards mankind, possibly due to a previous encounter with them, and was willing to break the law of the jungle to satisfy his thirst for their blood. He always makes grand gestures about the ever-changing nature of the jungle, ranting to Akela how he allowed the man to live among the inhabitants. However, he was also incapable to think that perhaps he was also one of the reasons that the humans are cruel towards their environment."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"ike his previous versions, The Grinch started out as a cranky, grumpy, solitary, and selfish creature who likes to bully and antagonize the citizens of Whoville whenever he can. He takes some sadistic pride in his work, sees an artistry and style to being generally mean and nasty."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"However, deep down, he has a soft spot as he shows to his dog Max and a select few individuals that manage to appeal to it under his rough exterior."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After learning the true meaning of Christmas, he redeemed himself and realize that he wasn't alone anymore, because of Cindy Lou's kindness."
Chris Evans,"Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Rogers has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original values and character. Since his reawakening, Rogers was saddened by losing so much of his time, but still retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. He was also very empathetic; being able to understand and relate to both Wamda and Pietro Maximoff before meeting them and understanding Tony Stark's motivation during the Avengers Civil War, despite Iron Man being on the opposing side. He also conceded that Stark had very good reasons not to join the Time Heist and openly said he was happy that his friend had finally found the peace that he'd so desperately wanted."
Chris Evans,"What separates Steve Rogers from the other Avengers is two things: his humanity and morality. Steve Rogers is an extremely dedicated person. Despite originally being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of service to his country in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the war effort by starring in propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Barnes, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Rogers disobeyed his superior's orders and went behind enemy lines in an apparent suicide mission and rescued them. Rogers finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, and does not hesitate to stand up to corrupt politicians, hypocritical authority figures, powerful beings like Loki, or even the nearly omnipotent Thanos. His determination also aids him, giving him a boost in physical power to allow him to hold off beings of much greater strength, with this even allowing him to survive against Thanos. A true hero, Rogers is more than willing to sacrifice himself to protect others and does not care if he is considered the villain in his heroic job, as his desire to protect the innocent remained as strong as ever, even after he was deemed a criminal. Though he refused to give up in the immediate aftermath of the Snap, following the disastrous Ambush on Thanos, even Rogers conceded defeat. When Scott Lang returned however, Rogers quickly got his fighting spirit back, being the first to support Scott's plan. The true extent of his determination and selfless heroism was fully exemplified when he finally proved himself worthy to wield Mj������lnir. Amusingly however, when facing off with his past self, Rogers actually seemed annoyed by his own she"
Chris Evans,"Captain America's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness often puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a grey morality to protect people. This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. This difference in attitude, reached a head in the Avengers Civil War, where Tony sought to compromise with governments who were increasingly intolerant with collateral damage, while Rogers refused to do so, believing it would inhibit the Avengers' response time, eventually causing him to become a fugitive. Rogers nevertheless still cared for Tony and did not desire for them to fight, as he pleaded with Tony to stop attacking Bucky, as the latter did it without having control and did not kill him after beating him, even going as far as to send him a letter to apologize and a phone so Stark can contact him. He was visibly ashamed when Tony demanded him to tell the truth of his parents' death, and felt enough sympathy and remorse for keeping the truth hidden that he relinquished his shield and returned it to the Stark family. Two years later, after much of the anger between the two factions of Avengers had died down, Rogers outright referred to Iron Man as Earth's ""best defender,"" even joking that he himself was a poor substitute emphasizing the respect he maintained for Tony."
Chris Evans,"While Captain America's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought to be a dead best friend, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship. This reached its apex in the Avengers Civil War, where Steve steadfastly refused to give up on Bucky, which caused the Avengers to fracture along with more than half their number to become fugitives."
Chris Evans,"Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone, or greatly aged. Even while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new complicated world. Although he eventually reunited with both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a ""man out of time."" However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of the second incarnation of the Avengers."
Chris Evans,"He is very protective of his friends from his past, especially Bucky Barnes, and is willing to go to great lengths to save them, being susceptible to emotional and violent acts to fulfill his goal. He seems to have developed a trust and attraction towards Sharon Carter. During his time with the new team of Avengers, he developed a trust and bond with Black Widow. He also embraces links to his own time, often seeing much of Howard Stark in Tony. He is also very selfless and is willing to risk his life for his teammates, such as when he jumped in to save Black Widow from Proxima Midnight, without knowing he would be strong enough to hold back her spear."
Chris Evans,"He does have a darker side, however, with Ultron noting that Rogers had been a soldier for so long, he subconsciously craved conflict and battles to avoid a civilian life and being forced to confront all he lost. Indeed, his worst nightmare, caused by Maximoff. Maximoff, was shown to be the end of the war, with people not needing him anymore, leaving him with one hollow realization: everyone whom he had ever loved was gone, and he was alone. Overall, Rogers is a selfless person but one with a notable blind spot: his childhood friend Bucky Barnes. The last living link to his time, Rogers was willing to do everything to protect him, going so far as to abandon his role as leader of the Avengers and a team player. When Tony called Rogers out on failing the role of Captain America, at the end of their fight during the Avengers Civil War, Rogers abandoned his shield and with it, the identity of ""Captain America,"" heeding Tony's point. Even years later, he had made no efforts to reclaim the moniker allowing his uniform to darken and removing the American stars that had once adorned it."
Chris Evans,"Rogers has a strong dislike for agencies or groups that express control over the individual, due to having fought vigorously for his nations' freedom and losing the world he knew for that very reason. This dislike extends to groups of any ideology be they HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., or even America's own government. Rogers himself admits that the Howling Commandos committed less than moral actions during World War II, but it was for the basis that people could be free, whereas Project Insight was using fear to dissuade a national security risk before it happens, eliminating the need for a soldier like himself and taking away the American people's freedom. The desire for free will heavily influenced Rogers' opinion on the Sokovia Accords. He strongly believed that the extravagant politics involved would restrict (or at least hinder) the Avengers' efforts to protect innocent people, putting him at odds with the very pragmatic Tony Stark on the issue. His opinion on such groups lessened, when the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre locked up Barnes in a cage. In the end, such was his dislike that he cut all ties with them and became a fugitive after the Avengers Civil War. While he still retains his desire to protect the innocent, he has no desire to be re-acknowledged as a superhero and does not care about the opinions of government bodies, as he coldly told Thaddeus Ross that he did not care if the latter disapproves of him and even went as far as to say he would not hesitate to fight him if he got in his way."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy is fiercely optimistic and independent. Since childhood, she had harbored a dream to become a police officer, to make the world a better place. She cares for the well-being of others, and is always willing to extend a helping hand."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Due to being a rabbit, a species not known for being police officers, Judy faced continuous doubt from those around her, from her parents to local bullies. Nevertheless, she used this doubt as a means to increase her determination; she believed in the importance of always trying and making an effort to reach her goals, one of which was to eventually become a police officer of Zootopia, a city where predator and prey supposedly live together in peace and harmony, believing she will be quickly accepted amongst her peers. Unfortunately, she was too idealistic in this regard and found herself unprepared when facing the reality that city had both positive and negative aspects including prejudice, stereotyping, and profiling."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Unfortunately, Judy's fierce determination, at times, causes her to be overconfident and impulsive. She is shown to leap into action without always taking the time to fully think things through. This leads her to: abandon her post on parking duty to pursue Duke Weaselton into Little Rodentia causing considerable mayhem; almost get herself fired by taking on the Otterton case without permission; stake her career on being able to solve that case in 48 hours before learning that she has no resources; threaten to expose Mr. Big to his face which leads to him deciding to ice her and Nick; steal an entire train car full of evidence, rather than simply taking some key evidence to the ZPD. This leads to them nearly crashing into another train and ultimately destroying almost all the evidence."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Despite the odds, Judy remains optimistic and determined, adapting herself to the environment of Zootopia and those around her to build up both the way she presents herself and pursue her goals. She is clever, kind, and resourceful, which proves to be her greatest asset. She tarnishes the stereotype of a ""dumb bunny"", being intelligent enough to outsmart professional con artist, Nick Wilde, several times. Months of training at the Zootopia Police Academy has also left her tactical, with an impressive amount of physical prowess. During times of chaos, she can quickly take charge of a situation by concocting an efficient plan on the spot, being daring enough to take dangerous chances, in order to potentially end the day victorious. More often than not, Judy comes out successful as a result of this."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy believes that predators and prey should be treated equally and works to follow that belief. However, due to her childhood experience, having been bullied, attacked and injured by a fox, Judy harbors a degree of unconscious fear of predators (mainly foxes), such that while she is aware that predators don't pose a threat, there is a small part of her that does believe they could revert to their primitive savage ways."
Jack Black,"Po is usually easygoing, playful, and cocky like a big kid, as well as rather ""fanboyish"" when expressing his love for kung fu. In the first film, he is seen as a huge kung fu fan, owning posters and action figures of his favorite warriors, but is himself clumsy, portly, and having low self-confidence, only dreaming he could be a great warrior while feeling stuck in his unfulfilling life at his father's noodle shop. But when given the chance, he is all too eager to learn kung fu the hard way, enduring physical beatings and insults in hopes of changing who he is. After learning that ""there is no secret ingredient"", Po shows the inner strength to save the Valley of Peace by using his own skills and ingenuity and in the end becomes his own hero."
Jack Black,"Po possesses a kind and selfless nature, and is generally friendly and laid back. He also has a strong sense of justice, and is willing to risk his life to protect others. Though immature and oblivious in some situations, Po is able to take things seriously when it is called for, and is not hesitant to accept heavy responsibility���������at times taking on more than he can handle. He is also capable of learning things very quickly with the right motivation, as shown in the first film, and has memorized a vast amount of knowledge about kung fu, even being reliable enough to"
Jack Black,"Po also displays an action-craving attitude along with a natural affinity for humor, and isn't above acting clownish and dishing out quips, even making fun of himself, in order to entertain others. Imaginative and adventurous, he continues to act excitable and marvel over his heroes even after he has become the Dragon Warrior, at times leaving them embarrassed by his behavior. As Po tends to be less serious and disciplined than other masters, he also tends to think more outside the box, and will find different, creative ways to solve a problem if need be. Po has also broken some rules and traditions (as well as still having a habit of breaking physical things), though this is often unintentional. Po's lack of discipline and flippant personality often give him an unintentional advantage over his enemies, since, combined with his appearance, it causes them to disregard him or struggle to take him seriously, so they are often shocked when he proves to be a tenacious and incredibly skilled warrior."
Jack Black,"One of the recurring plot lines in the television series is Po's struggle to not let his title affect his ego. Throughout the series, he is shown to have many adoring fans and he welcomes the attention, occasionally to the point that it begins to negatively impact his duties or those around him. Despite this, he also possesses the self-awareness to realize when he has made a mistake, and is willing to accept responsibility for his actions."
Jack Black,"Though having grown more confident since becoming the Dragon Warrior, Po nevertheless has moments of intimidation and self-doubt. Even as he tries to talk tough, this boisterous behavior tends to become more comical than threatening, and is perhaps a front for the panda's insecurities. Despite this, Po does have a sense of dignity and defiance, as shown in the first film when he argued with Master Shifu as he tried to leave the palace, and in the second film when he argued with Tigress in order to seek out Shen."
Jack Black,"In the third film, as Po is continuously pushed to his limits, first by Shifu making him the Master of the Furious Five and then the arrival of Kai and subsequent defeat of most of his friends, as well as having found his biological father and having to please both him and Ping, Po finally starts to reveal how for all his light-heartedness and optimism, he is not without limits. While confident in his fighting ability, Po is forced to reflect inwardly and rely on his mind and spirit in order to fully understand himself and, therefore, master Chi. He approached the challenge enthusiastically and diligently, but displayed anger, frustration, and doubt when Li admitted to lying. Po was quick to forgive his father, and, quickly adapts to his circumstances to defeat Kai."
Jack Black,"Po has not only matured since his days before learning kung fu, but his unlikely triumph as the Dragon Warrior has changed those around him. Simple, good-natured, and fueled by determination, Po has never held grudges, not even against those who doubt him or treat him with contempt, and is selfless when it comes to protecting those in need, even being able to show compassion for his enemies. Po is much like the opposite of the foes he faces, such as Tai Lung, Shen, and Kai, in that he shows light-heartedness and humility instead of arrogance and desire for more power. It is these qualities, as well as his great respect for kung fu and his loving heart, that mark Po as the Dragon Warrior, able to defeat such villains when no one else could."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is an exceptional and intelligent scientist on par with Hank Pym enough for the latter to consider him his rival. He, however, resented Pym for his ego and attempt to fire him. From this point on, he develops a fierce hatred for Pym, deriding his egotistical nature and arrogance. Beyond this resentment for Pym, however, he's rather kind and affectionate, getting along quite well with Scott Lang upon meeting him and commenting on his size-increasing trials in the old days."
Laurence Fishburne,"It is later revealed that Foster deeply cares for Ava Starr, doing whatever he could to heal her of her condition. This love is so deep that he treats Starr like his own daughter, tolerating several of her more ruthless actions, and refused to leave her side, even when his life was at risk. Despite his love for her, Foster's tolerance for her actions has a limit; this is particularly seen when Starr suggested kidnapping Lang's daughter. Foster vehemently rejected the idea, going so far as to say if she laid one finger on her, he would no longer help her. Despite Starr's attempt to push him away, Foster could not turn his back to her and decided to go off the grid with her."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is shown to be a loyal and devoted friend, as it was his friendship with Elihas Starr that drove him to try to help Ava in the first place and having been good friends with Janet van Dyne, her and Elihas's fates being among the prominent reasons why he resented Hank, with Foster indicating that he had tried to persuade Janet to avoid being with Hank and regretting his failure that caused her seeming death, Foster, despite at first dismissing the potential that Janet would be ripped apart if he extracted her quantum energy, eventually came to hesitate doing so out of concern of what would happen to his former colleague at the last moment, worrying that Pym may have been correct about van Dyne being ripped apart by the process, and urged Starr to find another way. Even with all that had happened between him and Hank, Foster never wanted him dead, as he did not allow Ava to kill Hank in her search for more quantum energies and was concerned when Hank feigned a heart attack. They eventually achieved a reconciliation of sorts, as Foster came to trust that Hank would help in Ava's recovery after he had saved Janet."
Marion Cotillard,"An idealist, Sofia believes she can better the world through her work at Abstergo[4] and seeks to eradicate humanity's violent impulses using science and the Pieces of Eden. In doing so, she hopes to create a more peaceful society."
Marion Cotillard,"A hard working scientist above all, she could be quite distant at times and often disregarded giving credit to others, such as taking credit for the Animus 4.3 concept art conceived by Layla Hassan."
Marion Cotillard,"Her relationship with her father Alan Rikkin was difficult and estranged most of the time; where he sought to contain the Assassin threat, she only sought to contain violence itself."
Michael Fassbender,"Affected by the death of his mother, Callum grew up with a disdain for violence against women. On one occasion he killed a pimp, although such an action would lead to his eventual arrest and death sentence. Callum also initially had no interest in the Assassins' fight and opposed them out of spite for his father."
Michael Fassbender,"After several sessions in the Animus 4.3, Callum developed the Bleeding Effect and saw his ancestor Aguilar as a hallucinatory phantom. When Callum violently desycnhronized from an Animus session, he was left temporarily paralyzed from the waist down."
Michael Fassbender,"Callum's opinion about his father and later, Assassins, changed after he confronted Joseph about Mary's death in which the latter explained that he did what he had to do to prevent the Templars from claiming Aguilar's Apple of Eden (though it was Mary who forced his hand due to his moment of weakness, the same reason he couldn't kill his son). Initially siding with Templars in the search for the Apple of Eden in question, Callum soon understood what Joseph truly felt at the time when relieving the moment his ancestor Aguilar was forced to watch Maria dying during the Templars' betrayal. This, coupled with meeting phantoms of his parents along with those of his parents who inducted him into the Assassins, he eventually embraced his lineage and continued his parents and fellow Assassins' battle against Templars."
Michael Fassbender,"Erik has lived a troubled life, having felt mankind's cruelty not only as a mutant but also as a Jewish person. Erik was forced to watch as his people suffered under the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.[2] He is filled with hatred and anger mainly against Sebastian Shaw, who murdered his mother before his very eyes and forced Erik to experience horrendous tortures."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is absolutely devoted to the cause of protecting mutant kind, refusing to let mutants suffer a similar holocaust. Erik will protect his species at any cost, no matter how many human lives must be sacrificed.[2] His devotion to the cause and the fact that what he says about mankind is often true, many mutants have joined him over the years. He will even sacrifice his fellow mutants, if it will serve the cause, such as the pawns of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Mystique,[3] once he found out about the Sentinels.[4] However, despite his devotion, he refused to put his life on the line unless he had no other choice and was more than willing to sacrifice mutants if it would keep him out of harm's way, forcing Rogue to take his place in a machine that would kill its user and letting the ""pawns"" in his Brotherhood attack Alcatraz first, the former of which Wolverine called him out on saying if he was really righteous he would carry out his plan himself instead of endangering the life of a young girl."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto firmly believes that humans and mutants are not capable of co-existing, and believes mutants to be superior and the next stage in evolution. This conflicts greatly with the beliefs of Professor X, to whom Magneto frequently argues that if action isn't taken to ensure mutants' survival then a holocaust similar to that which he lived through will happen (a fate which indeed came to pass by 2023). He is not, however, above working with the X-Men when the situation calls for it despite the X-Men fighting to protect his enemies in addition to mutants, and when at death's doorstep in 2023 admits that he regrets all the years that he and Charles spent fighting each other despite their difference in goals."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is completely accepting of any and all mutants, regardless of their abilities who they are, what they have done, and their past with him (with the exception of Sebastian Shaw, who started Erik on his dark path by murdering Erik's mother in front of him and then experimenting on him).[1] Erik loves the mutant kind and will never turn away a mutant who wishes to fight for mutant freedom alongside him. In spite of this, Magneto does not seem to truly hate humanity on a fundamental level; he has had relationships with at least two human women, Ms. Maximoff[4] (which, unknown to him, led to the birth of his son Quicksilver) and his wife, Magda, whom he loved dearly.[5] Rather, Magneto hates and fears what humanity can (and in the original timeline, does) do to mutant kind, having survived the holocaust, and he does not wish to see that happen again to his fellow mutants. He is fully aware how cruel humans can be and sees that mutants can be paralleled to the Jewish population under Nazi rule. However, he does view mutants and humans as two very distinct species and does not believe that coexistence is possible.[2][1] He has, however, attempted this as of the revised timeline, which leads to his family being killed, which may have further cemented this belief. He believed Charles is naive and foolish for believing humanity will not always oppress and segregate mutants.[5] It can be argued that Magneto's hatred towards humans can be all in defense of mutant kind."
Michael Fassbender,"Along with standard police training, Hole undertakes specialized training in interrogation techniques and firearms at the FBI. His problematic and often unsocial behavior, as well as his obsessive tendencies during investigations, brings him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues. Bjarne M������ller, head of the Oslo Police Department, often shields Hole from being fired, believing he is a brilliant detective and vital to certain investigations. This repeated protection results in Harry feeling loyal and close to M������ller. Other in the police department whom he comes to trust include as friends Beate L������nn and Bj������rn Holm (both in the forensics division), Katrine Bratt (a Bergen detective who helps secure specialist information), and Gunnar Hagen (Harry's former senior officer prior to Phantom). Hole's skills become renowned enough that he is considered a specialist, leading him to be sought for occasional consultation by author travels to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police (who refer to him as ""Harry Holy"").[1] In the second novel, Cockroaches, he is called to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador."
Michael Fassbender,"Outside of the department, Hole develops a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke. Her son from a previous relationship, Oleg, comes to view Harry as a father figure, sometimes calling him ""dad."" After the seventh novel The Snowman, Harry's relationship with Rakel suffers. This, along with recent trauma, compels Hole to leave Oslo and the police force. The next novel The Leopard shows Harry living in self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Kaja Solness, a new Norwegian Crime Squad officer, asks him to return to Oslo to help investigate a possible serial killing. Learning his father Olav is also ill and likely to soon die, Hole agrees to help and returns to Oslo. During the story, Olav asks his son to assist in his suicide in order to end his pain, but Harry cannot bring himself to do so. At the end of the book, Harry has a brief reunion with Rakel before then visiting the imprisoned killer of The Snowman. It is implied that Harry then aids in the criminal's own suicide. Disturbed by his recent experiences, Harry determines to return to Hong Kong for good."
Ryan Reynolds,"Wade is a man with a deeply perverted, deranged and sometimes dark sense of humor. Probably Wade's most defining characteristics is his non stop motor mouth no matter the situation and his love of pop cultures from all periods of time such as referencing Mama June or having an Adventure Time wristwatch. As a mercenary Wade is usually only in for anything for money. He is pansexual, who will flirt outrageously with pretty much anyone."
Ryan Reynolds,"Despite this, as Weasel pointed out Wade does have some moral compass as shown when he had most of the money he took from helping a teenage girl with her stalker sent back to her and as pointed let the kid who was stalking her off with a simple while very threatening warning. Another of Wade's redeemable features is his love for his girlfriend Vanessa as he was shown to do anything even considering joining the X-Men to get the help of two of their members Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to rescue her. Wade also displays some heroic traits as shown when he tackles Negasonic Teenage Warhead out of the way of gunfire and going to great lengths to prevent mutant time traveler and soldier Cable from murdering teenager Russell Collins even if it was for the good of the future."
Ryan Reynolds,"Harry's relationship with his son is shown as being strained due to his work, where Tim was raised by his maternal grandmother rather than by him or his wife. However, Harry clearly makes an effort to reach out to Tim and cares for his son very much regardless, to the point where he was willing to set up a room for him to stay in and keep it clean for years just in case his son decided he wanted to live with him."
Will Smith,"Deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional: as long as he's been paid to kill someone, he will always carry it out without mercy, except women and children. He is also sarcastic and have a personal method where he has to be paid first to get his job done and will threaten his employers furthermore when he is offended, evidenced by wanting double the original payment for his job because his ""client"" was being a ""dickhead;"" alongside his sarcasm, he has an incredibly tough attitude, and can work even under the highest of pressure."
Will Smith,"Despite his sarcastic, tough attitude, Floyd notably strikes up a friendship with Harley Quinn quite quickly, empathizes with El Diablo after learning the latter's dark secret, is greatly respected by his teammates, and has influence over them (with Rick Flag himself pointing this out), and finally he cares deeply for his beloved daughter Zoe, keeping a picture of her with him throughout his time as an assassin and inmate. He also holds a strict code about not killing women and children in his line of work, thus proving himself to have a strict moral compass. Notably, when Amanda Waller attempts to psychologically manipulate Deadshot by promising him the freedom and a permanent reunion with Zoe in exchange for assassinating Harley Quinn, he is strongly tempted for a few long moments. Ultimately, however, with quite a bit of visible effort, Deadshot realizes his unwillingness to betray his moral code of not murdering women, as well as his friendship with Harley (most likely also due to him realizing that Zoe wouldn't have ever approved of the circumstances of such a permanent reunion if she knew), and so he resists, instead pretending to miss while shooting at Harley (though Deadshot may be willing to make exceptions, to his moral code in some situations, as he plotted with Harley to kill Rick Flag and Katana and contributed to Enchantress' defeat)."
Will Smith,"Also, while not outspoken about it, Deadshot appears to be at least somewhat religious, wearing a cross while in civilian apparel and having several biblical verses written on the gauntlets and neck of his combat bodysuit."
Will Smith,"Genie is full of life and bursting with positive energy. Though he is amongst the most powerful, chaotic beings in the universe, Genie is benevolent, easygoing, and friendly; so much so that he primarily uses his abilities as a means to amuse both himself and those around him. According to the filmmakers' commentary, Genie's energy is a direct result of his imprisonment; his years of isolation have left him teaming with vigor, so whenever he is given a chance at freedom, his first instinct is to go wild with his powers by cracking jokes and entertaining whatever audience he has. He is also inviting, as when he first met Aladdin, Genie immediately introduced himself as a friend to rely on and emphasized the fact that his purpose was to magically enhance Aladdin's life by any means necessary (so long as it did not interfere with the three rules of wishing)."
Will Smith,"Though he was generally devoted to whoever held temporary ownership of the lamp, Genie has always had a will and mind of his own, outside the bounds of a stereotypical genie slave. As seen during his time as Jafar's lackey, Genie's job did not require him to agree with his masters' morals. It did, however, force him to adhere to their three commands without question, no matter how vile they may have been. Nevertheless, he was still able to provide advice to masters that were willing to listen. In the first film, he served as a mentor figure to Aladdin, often giving the latter advice and encouragement when needed, as seen when he urged Aladdin to tell Jasmine the truth about not being a prince. As mentioned, Genie did not offer himself as a mere slave, but rather as a supportive friend to his masters. His friendship with Aladdin proved that he was capable of forming genuine relationships with masters, though it was not until Aladdin that Genie was treated as anything beyond a mere slave by his superiors. This tied to Genie's dream of being freed from the lamp."
Will Smith,"Though mischievous, manic, and explosive, Genie is also compassionate, wise, and serious when he feels it's necessary. He understands human emotions to a profound degree and takes matters such as love, trust, and being true to yourself quite seriously. His more sincere moments are indicated by his tone, which changes from wily and exuberant, to low and soft when he wants to get a serious point across. Despite this, he still tries to lighten even the darkest moments with a dose of comedy, an example of this being the climax of the original film, where Genie transformed into a cheerleading squad to root for Aladdin during his battle against Jafar."
Will Smith,"Junior was created from the DNA of Henry Brogan, a Defense International Agency assassin, by Clayton Verris, the director of a black ops terrorist organization, to end the life of the outgoing assassin."
Will Smith,"He was dispatched to Colombia to find and kill Henry Brogan, almost getting on equal footing with him. Arriving at a safehouse, he is revealed to be Clay's adoptive ""son"". He is ordered to finish the job despite being curious on how he possesses similarities to Henry. Henry is also troubled by his similarities to the assassin, whom Danny suggests might be his child despite Henry's denials. He tells Baron to take him to Hungary. DNA testing reveals that Henry and Junior's DNA are identical, proving that Junior was a clone of Henry all along. Henry then meets Yuri, and learns of the cloning project and that the man he killed was one of the project's scientists. Having designed a method to produce clones devoid of pain or emotion, the scientist tried to leave the project and was killed upon being discovered."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his physical shortcomings, Hiccup does his best to succeed as a Viking. He is intelligent and is constantly creating inventions for various uses throughout the first film, including a bola launcher, a dragon's prosthetic tail and saddle, and a riding vest. However, he is much stronger than he appears."
Jay Baruchel,"Overall, Hiccup is an intelligent, kind, and likable person who is naturally big-hearted and innocent. After the first film, he and Toothless have become ""adrenaline junkies"", performing tricks like free-falling. He has also gone from being a shy boy to a confident young man, and ""the greatest Dragon Master this world has ever seen"" (as Astrid describes him to Drago Bludvist). He has a charitable and kind nature which allows him to see the good in everyone. He has especially shown to care deeply for Toothless, his parents, Stoick and Valka, Astrid, and later their children Zephyr and Nuffink."
Jay Baruchel,"He is very protective of Astrid and in the first movie, he has a crush on her. Their feelings mature as they grew up and as the franchise progressed. Among the other teenage Vikings, Hiccup first comes off as awkward, mainly because he's a poor fighter, and rather scrawny for a Viking, prompting mockery from his peers. As he becomes more adept at fighting dragons, however, they start paying more attention to him, and friendships start developing. Despite this, Hiccup remains shy and secretive, preferring to be alone with Toothless. He also tends to be sarcastic with a dry sense of humor that can sometimes put him at odds with the other Vikings in his tribe. It also seems that Hiccup likes to hide his fear with said sarcasm and dry humor. Due to his shyness, he had a habit of stuttering and stammering when talking to some of the other Vikings, especially Astrid, or when his father is angry at him."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his many virtues and his clear capabilities as a leader, Hiccup is not without his flaws. He is rather prone to letting his insecurities cloud his judgment and affect his actions; in the film, his desperation for the acceptance of his tribe, and his father in particular, cause him to regularly attempt to kill dragons along with the villagers, only to end up doing more harm than good due to his clumsiness. In Dragons: Riders of Berk, his mistaken belief that Stoick still does not accept him causes him to lead the other Vikings on a potentially dangerous treasure hunt to prove himself in ""Portrait of Hiccup as a Buff Man"". His innate friendliness and tendency to give others the benefit of the doubt cause him to be a little too trusting of strangers, leaving him vulnerable to manipulation and deceit by more dishonest characters, such as Heather and Mildew, on more than one occasion."
Jay Baruchel,"One extremely notable character trait Hiccup possesses is a deep sense of compassion. As a child, he is seen empathizing with his father over the loss of his mother, and even crying at the thought of an injured bird being killed in order to put it out of its misery. He later spares Toothless, and in doing so, changes the world of Vikings and dragons forever. He was extremely uncomfortable with the thought of having to kill a dragon in the arena in the first film. Hiccup carries this quality into the television series. He shows great sympathy to Snotlout at the end of the Thawfest Games, giving up his own glory and fame for the sake of his friend, though Snotlout showed no gratitude at all. He will almost never allow Toothless to use his full power against foes to prevent killing them. In ""What Flies Beneath"", he begs Toothless to spare a Whispering Death that had nearly killed both of them just moments earlier. The peak of Hiccup's sympathy is displayed in his releasing Mildew from an Outcast cell. Upon seeing the Outcasts take Mildew's one beloved possession, his sheep, Hiccup clearly displays pity for the old man. Unfortunately, Hiccup is occasionally naive in his sympathy, as Mildew betrayed him yet again right afterward. Still, his kind heartedness has resulted in many victories and accomplished the training of the deadliest dragons in the world."
John Dimaggio,"Harvey Bullock was the police chief of Gotham City and was also known as ""Bulldog"". Under Commissioner James Gordon, the city had to deal with the murders of women committed by Jack the Ripper. During the inauguration of the Gotham World Fair, Sister Leslie and Selina Kyle complained to Mayor Tolliver about the murders, but Bulldog blamed her shelters being responsible for attracting loose women. When Bruce Wayne showed up, he tried escorting the disrupting ladies out, only to be interrupted by Bruce who went to talk with Leslie and Gordon privately."
John Dimaggio,"He attended Leslie's funeral after she was murdered by the Ripper, and arrested Marlene Mahoney when she started threatening to Bruce that she would reveal he was near the scene of Leslie's murder. Later when Hugo Strange was murdered at the Arkham Asylum, Bullock and his fellow officers spotted Batman and Jack fighting atop a police blimp. As they shot toward them, they accidentally hit the blimp and caused it to crash land. Bulldog went after Batman,, assuming he was the killer, and gave his men orders to kill him on sight. Gordon however soon arrived to restrain him and stated he wanted him alive. Later when Marlene was found murdered, the police suspected Bruce and Harvey Dent told them that he should be at Selina's hotel."
John Dimaggio,"When Victor Fries was a child he made a hobby of freezing animals in order to preserve them so they can continue to exist in the future. Worried by this behavior, his parents sent him to a strict boarding school where Victor felt outcast and became depressed. However, when he met and befriended a young woman named Nora, the two fell in love and later married. But their happiness was short-lived: Nora was diagnosed with a fatal disease, and Fries, sickened with sorrow, attempted to save her using cryogenic technology. However, the experiment went terribly wrong and Fries' equipment malfunctioned, consuming him and his lab in an explosion of ice."
John Dimaggio,"Victor somehow survived, but now his body could only survive at sub-zero temperatures, and Nora's condition was now even more serious. In an effort to continue his wife's treatment, he constructed a suit which would now protect him in his altered state. Calling himself Mr. Zero, he began to rob several banks to get money. He was eventually thwarted by Batman and Robin, but struggled on. As Mr. Zero, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range."
John Dimaggio,"Although technically not insane, he is usually imprisoned in Arkham Asylum when apprehended by the Batman, as it is the only facility in Gotham that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell."
Keanu Reeves,"Due to his harsh background and being rigorously trained for his childhood and adulthood by The Director and his career in the Marines, John could be described as a very serious and stoic individual who rarely speaks more than is necessary (preferring actions over words and being described as someone who never wastes words) with a strong sense of obligation. As a professional assassin and hitman, John is highly confident in his abilities and reputation, being greatly respected and feared by many criminal organizations and other assassins alike. Despite this, he has a strong moral code as well as honor which is unique among his colleagues according to Zero as John never willingly drags innocent people to his job or threatens them during it. In spite of his professionalism, he is also friendly and develops strong friendships with many other dangerous people like Marcus and even managers of Continental Hotels, like Winston and Shimazu. His good side is also seen after meeting Helen, John was willing the end his career as a killer and live a normal happy life with her, which Winston referred to as impossible."
Keanu Reeves,"However, John is a man who is worth his reputation as The Boogeyman for his lethality as he never failed on his missions. Despite his calm and collected behavior, once he's angered or taken by vengeance, he will stop at nothing until he kills his target no matter who or what stands in his way. After a puppy from his wife, which was the last posthumous gift from her not to be alone, was killed and his car stolen, John set out on a journey for revenge, which he's successful but also makes other problems for himself on future eve"
Keanu Reeves,"Despite his skills, John prefers to avoid fights if he can. He is skilled at getting people to back down without resistance and will often let people go when they do and he is able to avoid allowing conflicts to escalate any further as seen when he was able to call a truce with Abram Tarasov and when he allows Zero's students to live after beating them in a fight. His friendly and professional personality allows him to maintain contacts within the assassin community who are willing to come to his aid when needed. His strong sense of honor also means he makes a point of not allowing innocent people to get caught in the crossfire of his work."
Amy Adams,"Lois is a resolute, tough, and persistent reporter, who always seeks the big scoop and story. When putting aside her job description however, Lois is shown to be kind and fair, and after her first meeting with Superman, she was so smitten with the selfless heroics, as well as the childhood pain that he had endured all his life, that she decided to drop what could have been the biggest story in modern human history for him. Superman comes to fairly quickly reciprocate her love, and after having dated her for 2 years, his love for Lois became so great, that Clark goes so far as to let her know that ""[she] is [his] world"" before confronting Doomsday in a mortal duel, making those his final words. When Superman gets resurrected with a Mother Box and suffers post-mortem amnesia, only Lois manages to save the Justice League from him, as seeing her again made Superman begin to remember his past life."
Amy Adams,"Lois also showed exceptional courage, boldly going on board the Black Zero starship with Superman when the fearsome Faora demanded it, risking her life to help foil General Zod's plan (by participating in the Phantom Drive collision counter-plan), boldly standing up to Lex Luthor with righteous anger when brought before the malevolent supergenius, risking her own life to save Superman from Batman, later risking it again to retrieve the Kryptonite spear (so that Doomsday could be stopped), and later even boldly confronting a sinister resurrected Superman (despite him having just defeated the whole Justice League in a fit of rage, as Lois correctly believed that seeing her would jump-start his memories and return his former personality)."
Amy Adams,"Lois is also quite tough, enough to be willing to kill, as she shot several Sword of Rao Kryptonians while escaping the Black Zero."
Felicity Jones,"While growing up alone from the age of fifteen, Jyn is considered reckless and undisciplined. Having little patience for debate with Alliance High Command, she prefers to take matters into her own hands."
Felicity Jones,"Even as a child, Jyn began developing a rebellious attitude but has a clear sense of right and wrong gained from her parents while growing up on Lah'mu. During her time with Saw Gerrera's insurgents, she developed a strong bond with the extremists."
Felicity Jones,"Initially, Jyn cared little about the Rebel Alliance's cause, but after watching the hologram message from her father, Galen Erso, Jyn realized how important it was that the Galactic Empire be rid from the galaxy and sacrificed herself for their cause."
Felicity Jones,"As a result of being trained by Saw Gerrera and being abandoned, develop calm yet cold demeanor, In addition, she is aggressive and distrusting, fighting off the Rebellion squad that was sent to rescue her, and keeping others at arms length until the battle at Scarif."
Felicity Jones,"Despite her aggressive and cold demeanor, Jyn is intelligent, kind, caring, selfless, has a sense of justice, honor and good morals."
Felicity Jones,"Jyn's relationship with Cassian Andor was initially complicated, as the two didn't trust one another when meeting. After learning that the immoral rebel general Davits Draven ordered him to kill Galen, she learned of his experience from the war, and the two would later become respectful allies once they disobey orders and headed to Scarif. Her relationship with K-2S0 was distasteful, with the latter having restrained her when she attacked the squad that was sent to rescue her. Despite this, K-2S0 showed himself to care for Jyn, saying he will do anything for her, and sacrificing himself for her and Cassian in his last moments."
Diego Luna,"A good Rebel agent who held dark secrets,[16] Andor was a human male standing at 1.78 meters tall[7] with brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin.[8] A man with striking good looks, Andor used his handsomeness to lure in the unsuspecting during his service as a Rebel spy."
Diego Luna,"As a Rebel, Andor was a committed, steady, practical, and by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience,[8] but that experience grew from missions that sometimes blurred the line between what was morally wrong or right. Despite his selflessness,[17] he was cold and distant to others.[16] Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary.[8] During the days of the early rebel movement, he relied on the excuse that he was following orders to justify what he had done."
Diego Luna,"Although he displayed some degree of remorse and regret after some of his actions, such as he chose to execute Tivik during the mission to the Ring of Kafrene, it was never enough to convince him to seek redemption until his adventure with Jyn Erso.[8] Nevertheless, he was more morally conflicted than fellow insurgent Saw Gerrera, who also went to great lengths to uncover intelligence on topics, particularly weapons, that threatened the Rebels.[17] In a briefing to Mothma, General Draven described Andor as ""one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,"" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion.[46] Indeed, many of the missions he carried out for the Alliance were morally questionable.[17] Mothma wondered if the command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions."
Diego Luna,"Comprising on their morals in the name of victory was dreadful for the emotional health of Rebels like Andor. In truth, Andor had been driven to the extremes he carried out by the anguish he carried inside him. Having lost everything in his life, Andor was able to hold back thinking about his morally questionable actions[17] until his time with Erso.[8] Whether it was due to killing Tivik or a change in his outlook due to the adventure he had with Erso,[17] he disobeyed orders to kill Galen Erso[8] before revealing his internal anguish by arguing with Jyn; she compared him to a stormtrooper for following orders he thought were wrong,[17] which made him burst out in anger because of all he had done in the name of rebellion.[8] In the end, Andor's selflessness[17] and regret for his past actions[8] led to him joining the ragtag Rogue One mission.[17] Meeting Erso and joining that mission helped Andor remember why he became a Rebel agent in the first place.[16] Paying the ultimate sacrifice he could in the apogee of his selfless devotion to the Rebel Alliance[17] and wanting to bring a new hope to the galaxy, Andor willingly gave his life[16] to ensure the Death Star plans were given to those who could use them to win the war."
Ryan Gosling,"A Nexus-9 replicant model, Officer K was inherently obedient and devoted in his duty as a member of law enforcement in Los Angeles. He was predisposed to be truthful and loyal to his superiors."
Ryan Gosling,"Despite his cool and collected demeanor, K could and would demonstrate that he was an experienced, hardened police officer capable of turning aggressive and contentious."
Ryan Gosling,"He thoroughly enjoyed listening to vocal jazz and standards, big band jazz and the like. K also indulged himself with bourbon upon returning from a hard day's work."
Ryan Gosling,"K's investigation pushed him to the limits, both emotionally and physically, yet ultimately he chose to act selflessly and courageously as he rescued Deckard from the Wallace Corporation."
Jason Bateman,"His primary expression is the Sly Fox which is the persona he adopted after his traumatic encounter with Pack 914 as child. However, at heart, Nick has always wanted to be a Junior Ranger Scout and the qualities they demonstrate. There are hints throughout the movie that he never fully gave up that dream."
Jason Bateman,"This is the primary image Nick presents during the film. This ""Nick Wilde"" is shifty, sly, and cunning, traits supposedly common to all foxes. He is easygoing and slick, easily conning and tricking others through his charm, quick-talking and friendly demeanor. He nearly always has a sly smile on his face with half-lidded eyes and appears unfazed throughout most of the film. He is very street smart and intelligent, and uses his vast knowledge and experience of Zootopia and its people to his advantage when carrying out his schemes."
Jason Bateman,"This personality is Nick's response to being the shifty and untrustworthy fox that society expects of him as well as providing a mask that he can hide behind so they can never see that they got to him. As a result, he deals with prejudiced statements directed at him behind an easygoing facade and often delivers a snarky comeback in response."
Jason Bateman,"The Sly Fox is particularly good at reading his fellow mammals. During their brief encounter at the ice cream shop, he picks up on Judy's naivety, idealism, and desperateness to be seen as a real officer despite her current assignment as a meter-maid. He takes all he had learned and distills it into the devastating ""whoopsie"" speech he gives later when Judy tries to arrest him."
Jason Bateman,"Because Nick has operated with this persona for over twenty years, many of the traits of this mask are now part of Nick's personality. His feeling that he needs to be shifty has led to a cynical outlook on life in Zootopia such that he feels that animals can only be what they are and never what they want to be."
Jason Bateman,"To those that take the time to get to know Nick, they will find that he is loyal and caring to his friends. His friendship with Judy evolves to the point where he risks his life to help and protect her throughout the film. He even shows a softer warmer side to himself, comforting her over her mistakes and giving her advice."
Jason Bateman,"Finally, it is noteworthy that during his Junior Ranger Scout initiation, Nick promises to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. During his time with Judy, he fulfills every aspect of that oath."
Dwayne Johnson,"Maui is boisterous, gregarious, and mischievous. His manner of carrying himself matches his massive physique, being larger-than-life and a true god among men. He is responsible for most of the necessities and luxuries currently belonging to mankind, and with his magical fish hook at hand, is amongst the most powerful figures in South Pacific lore. Widely regarded as a clever trickster, Maui is rarely matched when it comes to adversaries, being greatly feared by villains and monsters lurking throughout the sea. Maui can be extremely arrogant and pompous as a result of this reputation, although it is justifiable in every way. While his prideful ego can lead him to perform antagonistic and selfish acts, Maui is a lot less careless as a first impression may perceive."
Dwayne Johnson,"As a result of his poor upbringing, Maui has spent a majority of his life living with crippling insecurity. He goes out of his way to perform godly deeds for mankind's benefit to compensate for the love and appreciation denied to him by his parents. While he seems to enjoy the praise he earns, he secretly wishes he could be appreciated beyond his demigod status; as the human he is on the inside, rather than the deity portrayed in legends. Even so, Maui's daring adventures over the centuries shaped him into a mighty hero. Before meeting Moana, Maui credited the gods for his greatness, completely contradicting his initial arrogance. He believed he was nothing without his deity-created fish hook, and openly lamented how useless he viewed himself whenever the hook was decommissioned. Through Moana, however, he slowly began to realize that the hook is only an accessory during his adventures and that his many accomplishments over the years were a result of his own selflessness and bravery, rather than what the gods conjured to assist him in such exploits. He discovered that Moana's words of wisdom were correct when he fought relentlessly against Te K�� (without his fish hook) to save Moana and the world from destruc"
Rachel House,"Tala is spirited, eccentric, and independent. She is fiercely devoted to the idea of being true to yourself and ""listening to your heart."" As such, she never adhered to normality for the sake of fitting in, making her somewhat of an outcast, though she holds the reputation of ""village crazy lady"" with prideful awareness. She is also mischievous and playful, at one point noting that she can keep secrets from Tui if she so pleases; although he is chief, she is still his mother."
Rachel House,"Her independence nevertheless makes her a beloved and respected figure to Moana. The two share an extremely close bond, and Gramma Tala provides support and guidance throughout Moana's life. With her last remaining strength, she urges Moana to begin her journey to restore the heart of Te Fiti without delay. After her death, Tala appears to Moana in the form of a manta ray, as she told Moana she would, then appears later in her human form during ""I Am Moana (Song of the Ancestors)"" to offer her granddaughter unconditional love and wise counsel, helping Moana through her moment of deepest self-doubt."
Dwayne Johnson,"Mitch is very dedicated to his job, preferring to patrol the beach and save lives rather than sit in an office all day."
Dwayne Johnson,He shares a mutual bond with his son Hobie and tries to make things right if anything ruins their relationship.
Dwayne Johnson,He is a good friend and popular father figure to the other lifeguards who turn to him for advice and help. He has a good sense of humor with hobbies including surfing and basketball.
Dwayne Johnson,Mitch can be stern and serious when the situation demands especially if a person's life is at stake.
Dwayne Johnson,"Adam grew up as a slave in Kahndaq, being constantly mistreated and exploited by his leaders, which generated hatred towards them, but he was always full of courage and bravery to attend to situations that required it. Raising his son Hurut, Teth-Adam always tried to protect him from any evil, teaching him from an early age that the world they lived in was a dangerous one, contrasting with his son's premature desires to improve it. At some point, when Hurut observed how some gladiators mistreated a slave, he was about to help him, however Adam stopped him and told him that they couldn't do anything about it no matter how much they wanted to. However, Teth-Adam took pride in his son's morality and sense of fairness and justice, as Adam eventually smiled as Hurut handed his slice of bread to some slaves in need, telling Shiruta that he felt there was still hope in Kahndaq."
Dwayne Johnson,"Following the sudden death of his wife and son at the hands of King Ahk-Ton's forces, Adam was left traumatized and filled with emotional pain, which led him to became brutal, vengeful, cold, ruthless, and aggressive after the loss of his family to Akh-Ton's forces, Adam began misusing his powers and accidentally releasing the Seven Deadly Sins upon his family's murderers and the rest of the people of Kahndaq, killing millions. Having become invincible and taking revenge on his former leaders, Adam developed a strong ego that allowed him to consider himself unable to surrender to anyone. Teth-Adam also developed a twisted sense of justice, using a methodology where the ends (protecting Kahndaq) justify the means, so Black Adam doesn't mind coldly hurting and killing people to get what he wants. All these heinous acts caused him to be declared unworthy by the Council of Wizards, who tried to bury him and revoke his powers, however, Adam completely refused to surrender, killed the Council of Wizards as well, until he was finally buried by the wizard Shazam."
Dwayne Johnson,"Waking up in a modern world, Teth-Adam had a hard time adjusting, but continuing his brutal and vengeful nature, Adam murdered every Intergang soldier who got in his way, but taking pity on Adrianna Tomaz and Karim by instinctively saving them from being killed. a stone fell on them, because his divine wisdom predicted that they would be important in the near future. After some time and finding himself in the Tomaz residence, Teth-Adam was uncomfortable with Amon Tomaz's questions, but having compassion for the child, he simply asked him to get out of his way, even remarking that he was not a hero when he asked him to save Kahndaq. Likewise, Adam in his impression with the modern world, is surprised when he finds himself with a mirror or witnesses a television, believing that it was magic from sorcerers, Adam destroyed the television, and finding himself painful that the land in which he used to life would have changed, he went out to explore Shiruta City, curious about a statue dedicated to the champion of Kahndaq. Adam also does not have caution or care for other people's property, destroying the walls of the Tomaz residence instead of using the doors, this was even led to Kent Nelson pointing it out to him."
Dwayne Johnson,"Due to the danger Teth-Adam represented in the eyes of A.R.G.U.S., the Justice Society was sent in in an attempt to stop him, to which Adam, seeing himself threatened by them and unwilling to surrender, referred to himself as a god and that he would not kneel before anyone, easily gaining the upper hand. confrontation. Annoyed with the Justice Society and especially with Hawkman, Teth-Adam even threatened to kill them if they wanted to continue fighting, when Hawkman mentioned not disagreeing with fighting, Adam smiled. As soon as Amon Tomaz was kidnapped and Adrianna begged him to save him, Teth-Adam did not hesitate to go to the rescue and save him, killing every soldier who got in his way, which led him to have an ethical conflict with Hawkman, who was trying to convince him not to kill people since it was not something heroes should do, to which Adam remarked that he would kill if necessary, causing a brief confrontation between them. Adam was also open to having a sense of humor, adopting sarcasm when Kent Nelson mocked Adam saying he wouldn't murder people, Teth-Adam was soon sarcastic by mentioning that he loved teaming up with the Justice Society, only to then attack the Al Hadidiyah Mine, ignoring Hawkman's plans."
Dwayne Johnson,"Finding himself provoked by Ishmael Gregor who mentioned being a descendant of Ahk-Ton and mocked Hurut's death, as well as shooting Amon Tomaz, Teth-Adam unleashed all his wrath on preventing Amon's death and then took revenge by murdering Ishmael. Gregor, generating an explosion that destroyed everything around him, and if the Justice Society had not intervened, the Tomaz would have died. The intentional taunting of Adam allowed Gregor to be killed just as the Crown of Sabbac was placed, traveling to the underworld to gain demonic powers. Meanwhile, Teth-Adam was completely hurt and sorry for the damage he could have caused as well as all the massacres he committed in the past, so he finally decided to renounce his powers, traveling back to the palace of King Ahk-Ton to reflect on his actions, after Hawkman demanded his surrender and no longer feeling worthy of being the champion, Adam returned to his civilian form and voluntarily surrendered upon learning that no one could defeat him, asking Hawkman to lock him up and that they ensure he does not transform again, soon imprisoning him at the Task Force X Black Site."
Dwayne Johnson,"After Sabbac threatened to destroy Kahndaq, Kent Nelson awakened Teth-Adam in an attempt to stop him, convincing him that despite not being chosen by the Council of Wizards, he was worthy and destined to fight Sabbac. stating that he was wrong and that the world needed him, motivating Adam to escape from his prison by fighting A.R.G.U.S. guards. Remembering his son's legacy, Adam reactivated his powers and traveled back to Kahndaq, where he demonstrated that despite having to deal with overwhelming pain, Adam still had kindness in his heart and he was truly willing to give up his powers and/or sacrifice himself to protect Kahndaq and all of its inhabitants, even at the cost of his life, saving a group of civilians from having a statue fall on them and killing Sabbac with the help of Hawkman, after the battle, Adam ended up being more empathetic towards the Justice Society, even agreeing with Atom Smasher that they made a good team. Accepting his rightful role as the hero of Kahndaq, Teth-Adam finally agreed to protect the nation, but after being goaded to sit on Ahk-Ton's former throne, he deemed it wrong due to all the former king's atrocities, destroying it. Being more open to Amon's initial proposals to become a hero, Adam agreed to change his name to Black Adam, but still maintained his ego as the most powerful being on the planet, Adam was not afraid to confront Waller when she threatened him to stay in Kahndaq, causing Superman to arrive to request to talk."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Initially, Arthur is a deeply disturbed and broken man who is in a near constant state of anguish and clinical depression who still tried his best to be kind towards others. While he claims to enjoy certain things in life, it isn't clear if he is serious, as he once told his mother he was ""never happy for a single minute of his life."""
Joaquin Phoenix,"Ever since that he was born, however, Arthur Fleck was an altruistic and good man who didn't want others to suffer as he does, and always wanted to bring laughter and joy to the entire world, aiming to do so by becoming an famous comedian. However, he was often physically and mentally abused by his mother and her boyfriend due to being the estranged son of a billionaire, something Arthur later takes as hatred toward the rich and the powerful. As a result of being abused, Arthur dives deeply into depression and borderline personality disorder, he also develops pathological laughter created by the abuse."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Despite his mental health, Arthur would have never thought of giving up on his goal to be a popular comedian, and, when he goes to achieve this goal, he takes the job of a clown for a talent agency. As he was abused again by a group of teenagers, Arthur developed a hatred for society. Hence, Arthur's fragile sanity began to be broken, and he was still not giving up and found some joy in his mother and Sophie Dumond, until he wound up being humiliated by society again, this time by his beloved TV idol Murray Franklin."
Joaquin Phoenix,"When he shot the bullies, he ran to a public restroom and for the first time in his life, he experiences something unfamiliar to him: contentment. All the weight of the world, the expectations, moral obligations, all the put downs and times life had crushed him where alleviated. For the first time in his entire life, Arthur felt like he was in control and had achieved something meaningful. However, this was also one of several breaking points for Arthur and one of several lines he would cross, from that moment on he begins to develop a sociopathic persona, who lacks empathy, lacks remorse, is manipulative, violent, cold, aggressive and relentless."
Joaquin Phoenix,"As satisfaction and happiness introduced themselves to him, he dances triumphantly as he experienced all these new, wonderful, pleasant sensations. He waved his arms and swayed his head in euphoric delight. The pent-up blood cravings had manifested and were quenched. Killing felt GOOD, Arthur thought, and this satisfaction would need to be refueled again."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Arthur always loved taking care of his mother, until he learned that she wasn't his real mother and realized she had always been monstrous, false and negligent towards him, which moved Arthur to kill her, though the deed pained him. Upon meeting his estranged father, Arthur was in denial of how his father was denying his existence, yet showed joy with meeting Bruce Wayne, his estranged brother and yet-to-be his arch enemy."
Joaquin Phoenix,"After a breakdown, Arthur lost the capacity to fear anything and having scraped rock bottom for so long, he realized the only new direction to take is up as his life couldn't get any worse. He developed a totally nihilistic outlook on life and therefore decided to go with the flow rather than change anything."
Joaquin Phoenix,"As Joker, Arthur loved being completely freed from his depressed life he used to have, liking to think that his life is a comedy now rather than a tragedy, and, he later developed himself to become the leader of the Clowns after killing his TV idol in front of a horrified crowd, yet, he was already inside of his insanity, so he burst out in crazy laughter, which is commonly regarded as his first true and honest laugh in the film. Having triumphantly danced on a stair case, he finally basked in the embracing warmth of happiness and the sensation of pleasure which was new and wonderful to him. Once he accepts his new life as Joker, he expresses no remorse or regrets for any of his murders and actually seems to take pride in them and frequently made jokes about the people he killed. He also revels in the destruction and chaos he causes in Gotham, calling it ""beautiful""."
Joaquin Phoenix,"However even after his breakdown he had some moral standards as he allowed Gary to leave unscathed. He spared Sophie and her daughter as well because they never wronged him. After killing Murray, Arthur shoots Murray’s corpse a second time but didn’t shot Ms. Ruth or anybody else in the area despite the fact he easily could have done so since he still had bullets in his "
Joaquin Phoenix,Arthur also had a soft spot for children. He didn’t fight back against the teenagers who attacked him due to their youth. He enjoyed entertaining sick children at a hospital and a young child on a bus. He spared Sophie and her daughter and stopped himself from killing Alfred when he saw a young Bruce Wayne watching in horro
Joaquin Phoenix,"However, despite his moral standards, Arthur has committed many terrible crimes to get his point across. Also, as with most versions of the Joker, his mental illness makes it hard to tell which events of the film did happen. For example, while Franklin was a bit rude towards Arthur on his show, it is possible that it was part of the program. Therefore, it is possible that Arthur's decision on who to kill or not stems from a warped morality."
Matthew McConaughey,"Walter's ultimate goal is similar to his enemy, Roland's. He intends to take over the room at the top of The Dark Tower and become ""God of All"". Flagg attempts to manipulate Mordred Deschain by getting a hold of his birthmarked spider leg to open the door of the Tower. Upon meeting with Mordred to palaver, the young spider boy senses his intentions and forces him to tear out various body parts for Mordred's nourishment and then proceeds to kill him in a rather brutal manner."
Matthew McConaughey,"He is a wealthy drug lord who heads one of the most prominent marijuana drug empires in Europe. He originally hails from the United States, but moved to the United Kingdom to study at Oxford on a full scholarship, where he began selling weed to his fellow students. As head of the empire, Mickey oversees various aspects of the business, including production, shipping, and maintenance, and must also navigate conflicts with rival drug lords."
Matthew McConaughey,"Mickey is married to Rosalind, who is a successful businesswoman in her own right and runs a car shop staffed by women. The two have been happily married for a while and Mickey dreams of retiring soon to spend more time with her. However, his plans are complicated by a potential sale of his empire to American drug lord, Matthew Berger, for 400 million pounds. When Mickey encounters unexpected challenges, he and his right-hand man Raymond must work together to uncover a larger scheme before the deal falls through."
Matthew McConaughey,"Mickey's wealth affords him many luxuries, including caviar and fine wine. He is a savvy and cutthroat businessperson, much like his wife Rosalind."
Matthew McConaughey,"He is a cool and poised character who is skilled in speaking and outwitting others. He is charming and has a great sense of humor, but he is also strong and fierce. He understands that in his line of work, appearing vulnerable is not an option, so he always maintains his composure. He sees himself as a powerful lion in the jungle and believes that to truly be a ruler, one must embody the role with confidence and authority, as any hesitation or doubt can lead to destruction."
Chris Evans,"Ransom is an eccentric but spoiled brat, whose livelihood as a playboy is predicated on his family's wealth. This makes him arrogant and unpleasant in nature, but unlike the rest of the family, he does not hide this part and has no patience for that. However, while his family is indeed unpleasant and full of hypocritical jerks, Ransom is the only one who is truly evil because he is willing to do anything to have his part of the inheritance, including murder. He is overall a selfish, heartless, psychopathic and somewhat immature person, in addition to all his family's flaws. He behaves like a spoiled teenager, even though he is in his thirties. He claims to be seeking his ""birthright,"" but does not care about the rest of his family as long as he gets his own share. He is fully aware of his disgusting nature and he takes pride in the hate his family has on him. That said, he can be charming, charismatic and polite when he wants to be, in order to have what he wants. This is seen when he succeeds in earning Marta's confidence to help him get to the bottom of the case. He is also lazy, as he refuses to work and has no intentions in doing so. But he is intelligent, as seen with his plan to frame Marta for the murder of Harlan. However, his plan has several failures. For example, he himself hired the detective Blanc, thinking he would not find the truth behind the affair and he underestimated Marta's good nature, thinking she would not try to save the life of Fran. He also displays remarkable stupidity in some areas, thinking that ""stupid"" is spelled with an ""o"" instead of a ""u"".The psychopathic part of his personality comes when he is cornered by his self-confession of Fran's murder, by trying to murder Marta with a knife, simply out of spite and refusal to accept his failure."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is considered to be ""The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths"" and in many ways he fits that title. He's flamboyant, practical, gentlemanly, somewhat eccentric, but incredibly clever, intelligent, and overall a good detective. Blanc also speaks like a member of the Southern aristocracy with an accent that has been described by Ransom Drysdale as a ""Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn Drawl"". He has a tendency to use phrases and words that not many people understand, but also often employs the use of metaphors during his cases, such as likening the case of Harlan's death to ""a donut"" and his interest in the symbolism of the Glass Onion."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is at times sneaky, relentless, and snarky, but almost always in order to further progress during an investigation. He can also be very deceiving and manipulative, as shown by his ability to make both Miles Bron's ""Disruptors"" and the relatives of Harlan Thrombey lower their guards around him in order to get extra information."
Daniel Craig,"He takes his job seriously and always wants justice to be served, striving for the truth above all else. He can appear bumbling on occasions but in no doubt has a brilliant mind, as he was able to tell right away that Marta Cabrera had something to do with Harlan's death. He nevertheless trusted her, to the point of enlisting her help in the investigation, as he approached the case more concerned with who anonymously hired him. He appears to have drawn some inspiration for his work from Harlan's books, telling Marta that his father, a detective, respected Harlan and his work."
Daniel Craig,"He is also shown to be very kind. He appears to have a tendency of helping out the ""underdogs"", as shown by how he put his faith in Marta being a good person and working with her, and also by helping Helen with trying to find out who killed her twin sister. His kindness is also very clear when he tells Marta that she's a good nurse. He reassures others and is very caring, as shown when he calms a panicking Helen before she is almost shot, and when he very gently asks a weeping Whiskey to sit down elsewhere so that he can take care of Duke's body."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is also not without his faults; he admits to Helen that he is ""very bad at dumb things"", and calls it his Achilles' Heel. This includes games like Clue and Among Us, the former being called ""a terrible, terrible game"" by the detective, and the latter being a game he quickly loses and doesn't understand. He appears to have had a depressive episode during quarantine, as he would spend days not leaving the bathtub in his and Phillip's apartment, resulting in his partner and friends all worrying about him. He admitted to his friends that it's because his mind is ""a fueled-up racing car"" and that he had ""nowhere to drive it"", and that he tends to ""lose it between cases"". It can be assumed that the pandemic made Blanc struggle even further. He also gets extremely frustrated because of Miles, as he was expecting the murders he committed to be complex, but he realizes that they were exceedingly stupid. This, and him telling his friends over Zoom that he needs a challenge, shows that he prefers complex, difficult cases."
Taron Egerton,"Before he became a Kingsman, Eggsy was just a tough, rough and bitter individual due to his past. Despite the drugs and theft he was involved in, Eggsy has always been fiercely protective and loyal to those around him. He refused to compromise his friends by giving their names when he was arrested (despite being threatened with jail time) or revealing anything about Harry to both Dean and the interrogator, despite the threats from them both to kill him if he didn't. After he became a Kingsman agent, he soon became an extremely benevolent character."
Taron Egerton,"He's also sensitive towards animals, even crashing a car to avoid hitting a stray fox. However, it's this sensitivity that also leads him to fail the Kingsman tests, when he was required to shoot his dog."
Taron Egerton,"Eggsy also displays a very cocky and cool personality, much like every 'chav' teenager. He tended rebellion and conflict with authority figures, such as police, his parents and especially his stepfather."
Taron Egerton,The central figure in the folk-lore Robin Hood is an outlaw and excellent archer known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Robin and his group of outlaws known as the Merry Men lived in and operated out of Sherwood Forest.
Taron Egerton,"In the early ballad A Gest of Robyn Hode Robin is said to have gained a pardon from King Edward. Later Robin Hood's story was transported to a different period of English history to make the folk hero a supporter of King Richard The Lionheart who was declared an outlaw while the king was away fighting in the Third Crusade. Robin's opponents are the Sheriff of Nottingham, Guy of Gisbourne, the Bishop of Hereford, the King's brother Prince John was added to his stable of repeating villains in the late 16th century. Robin's cousin the Prioress of Kirklees was the foe that put an end to his life."
Taron Egerton,"The earliest surviving clear mention of ""the rhymes of Robin Hood"" is from the 1370s and paints him as an already established and well known piece of folklore. It is unknown if the ballads or the May Day Fair plays and games featuring Robin came first, though as time went on each clearly referenced stories told in the other medium. The earliest surviving ballad is a fragmented copy of Robin Hood and the Monk dating from about 1450."
Colin Firth,"Harry is a proper gentleman, but knows about people like Arthur that have a snobby attitude and unfairly judge others (which he agreed with Eggsy on). Harry told Eggsy about every man having his name only three times in the papers (when he's born, when he's married and when he dies) and about how posh accents don't make them anymore posh than they already are. Harry knows full well about moving with the times and claimed that Arthur saw it as a ""foreign policy"" when the latter denounced Lee as a potential agent, despite how much potential he had at being one."
Colin Firth,"Harry has always had great respect for his fellow colleagues; he was devastated when Lee and Lancelot were killed and surprised when Arthur claimed that Harry had not chosen a suitable candidate in Lee, ignoring his heroism in sacrificing himself for Harry by claiming Lee’s apparent lowly statue. Harry then stating that Arthur was a snob also seems to show Harry is not one to be afraid to stand up to people such as his bos"
Colin Firth,"Harry seems to have some deep regret about not having had any romantic relationships or having any ties, stating that nothing went through his mind when Valentine supposedly killed him. This led to him realising about how important Tilde is to Eggsy and told him about saving her when they went to stop Poppy."
Colin Firth,"While he acts like a polite and charming gentleman when people first see him, Wilkins is actually a ruthless and corrupt corporate executive. This is represented in the Royal Dalton Bowl, where his counterpart is a wolf who pretends to be as docile as a lamb, signifying how Wilkins is a metaphorical ""wolf in sheep's clothing""."
Colin Firth,"During the Great Depression, William Weatherall Wilkins was first seen in his office when Michael Banks and his sister Jane arrived to discuss with him about locating their late father George's shares in the bank to pay off a loan, as Michael is falling behind on his loan payments ever since his wife Kate died a year ago. Feigning sympathy, Wilkins informs Michael that he can't find George's file and that the Banks family has until Friday to pay off the entire loan or they will have to move out from the property. As Jane and Michael leave, it turns out that Wilkins has gotten hold of George's file and burns it as he intends to repossess the Banks house by all means necessary."
Colin Firth,"As Michael and his children think of several ways to pay off the loan (with the help from their nanny Mary Poppins), the children were about to deliver Michael's briefcase to the bank, only to eavesdrop on Wilkins congratulating his lawyers for repossessing 19 houses within the week and that he will repossess the Banks house regardless of any evidence of their ownership. Realizing Wilkins' true nature, the children tried to warn Michael about Wilkins' intentions, but Michael is unable to speak out for them as Wilkins dismisses the claims."
Colin Firth,"Just as the Banks family is about to move out on Friday, Michael spotted on his old kite a drawing that happens to be part of a certificate that proves their ownership. Despite Mary and Jack's attempts to help the Banks family deliver the certificate to the bank, they are missing the pieces with the signatures right before the clock strikes twelve at midnight. A triumphant Wilkins is about to declare victory, but it wasn't until the arrival of his uncle Mr. Dawes Jr., who happily informs Michael that George made some good investments that will allow the Banks family to keep both their house and the shares. Mr. Dawes Jr. also confessed that he caught wind of Wilkins's true intentions of driving more people out of their homes, so he fires Wilkins as punishment for his corrupt practices, much to Wilkins' distraught. He is then escorted away from the bank under Mr. Dawes Jr.'s orders."
Jamie Curtis,"At the end of the film, she discovers a letter from her father and learns that Richard is having an affair."
Jamie Curtis,"In the end of the film, Linda's fortunate life is about to be downcast. Her son, Ransom is arrested for technically murdering his grandfather, Harlan. Linda discloses her father's hidden letter and reads it. Eventually, she realizes that her husband, Richard, really has cheated on her. And, she and the rest of her other relatives lose the inheritance to her father's hired nurse, Marta Cabrera."
Jamie Curtis,"While Linda comes off as a stern, short-tempered woman, she is shown to care deeply for her immediate family. Linda appears to be close to Walt, referring to him as her ""baby brother"" and becoming defensive when the investigation pries into Walt's status within the publishing company (something her husband Richard does not)."
Jamie Curtis,"Unlike the rest of the family, Linda's motivation in receiving Harlan's inheritance does not appear to be a desire for financial gain, but possessiveness over her father."
Michael Shannon,Harlan fires his son after he keep insisting his father to allow Netflix to adapt his novels into movies to make more money.
Michael Shannon,"Walt, being the youngest, is the least mature and most spoiled out of all the family members. He also seems to be the family's failson. He is the most whiney which may have rubbed off on his ""alt right troll nazi"" son, Jacob Thrombey (although his wife Donna Thrombey likely had something to do with it too)."
Michael Shannon,"While Walt appears to be politically conservative, he does not share his son's far-right views: if anything, he is unaware of what Jacob is involved with."
Robert Downey Jr,"Many people in the media thought that Tony Stark was only just an egocentric playboy. As an adult, he was renowned for being casually arrogant, apathetic, callous, and a hedonist who enjoyed the finer things in life, namely drinking, gambling, partying and flirting. His wealth, power, and natural charm allowing him to get just about any woman he wants. But despite his rather carefree and overly confident personality, inside Stark's heart lay loneliness, as Ho Yinsen aptly described him as: ""A man that has everything, but has nothing."" Even following his reformation and birth as Iron Man, this stigma surrounding Stark persisted as many were quick to point fingers at him believing his arrogance and callous attitudes were the cause of many problems even if he would have only a tenuous connection to the issue at hand."
Robert Downey Jr,"Before his kidnapping, Stark was a self-centered, arrogant person, caring for few people outside his closest friends. Even during this period of his life, he had a moral code believing the weapons he developed were being used exclusively by the United States and its allies for peaceful purposes, being appalled to discover that they were being sold on the black market. He also funded large humanitarian inventions and programs via his arms dealings, something he felt justified manufacturing weapons."
Robert Downey Jr,"During the following years, however, Stark matured, gradually becoming more of a team player and less arrogant and cynical. He even began opening up and having a real relationship with Pepper Potts. Stark's exploits as Iron Man have lead him to reevaluate his life, thus he now strives to use his inventions in a more responsible and considerate way. A textbook example of a Byronic hero, he never fully let go of his character flaws, however, using them to push him forward as a reminder to do better and often making self-deprecating jokes or comments. Despite this attitude, Stark is an exceptionally brave and selfless individual as shown when he single-handedly faced a near-omnipotent Thanos armed with nothing but a knife without hesitation, a trait that earned him the Titan's genuine respect as a hero."
Robert Downey Jr,"His experiences while imprisoned by the Ten Rings, especially his injury and seeing his weapons being used by terrorists, hardened Stark into a brave, determined, and somewhat ruthless fighter. Seeing first hand how innocent people were being harmed by his weapons and business while he remained ignorant greatly enraged him, resulting in him being uncaring in killing his foes, though he avoided doing so when he could. He was also willing to kill to protect his allies and friends, boldly saying he would kill Drax if Star-Lord killed Spider-Man. Despite this, he was not merciless, as he offered several of Aldrich Killian's men a chance to stand down, allowing the sole survivor to leave peacefully upon doing so. Even when confronted by Captain America's betrayal, he offered the man several chances to step aside."
Robert Downey Jr,"Even after starting a new life as a superhero, Stark kept his sense of humor and his penchant for showmanship, the latter being demonstrated in his armor's red and gold color schemes, and in revealing his identity in public despite being told not to. Tony has also shown a strong liking towards heavy metal and rock music groups like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and Queen. He also shows signs of being a gearhead owning and modifying several expensive cars, having a particular liking towards the Audi R8 model line."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark was also known for being exceptionally intelligent, innovative and resourceful, having built a miniaturized Arc Reactor from scratch in Afghanistan. His intellect earned him the ""Da Vinci of Our Time"" nickname, and his inventions of Stark Industries have revolutionized technology for mankind. His past as a businessman had turned him into a very pragmatic individual always taking the quickest, most efficient way out of a problem commenting to Captain America that he would simply ""cut the wire"" when given the scenario of laying on barbed wire to let others cross it. This behavior put him at odds with the majority of the Avengers during the Avengers Civil War, as they were unwilling to compromise and negotiate with the United Nations regarding the Sokovia Accords which Stark viewed as the easiest way to continue the Avengers' mission of saving people and appease the public's growing fear and unease regarding the team. As a result of this negotiator attitude, Tony was one of three Avengers to not become a fugitive by the end of the Civil War and allowed to continue saving people with the support of the United Nations. This pragmatism extended to his fighting style, as he was quick to shift over to weapons more suited to the situation or having F.R.I.D.A.Y. scan Captain America's fighting style for openings to predict and exploit. He further displayed his combative pragmatism during the Battle of Titan by first restraining the Infinity Gauntlet before unleashing an unrelenting barrage on Thanos."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark could also be a reliable friend, and occasionally showed affection toward his teammates. Hence, Stark was the only Avenger who encouraged Bruce Banner to embrace his identity of Hulk as a blessing rather than a curse, and trusted him to make good use of Hulk's powers. He has also adopted a mentor role towards Peter Parker, seeing himself in the young hero, and helping him become better by designing an advanced Spider-Man Suit and quietly teasing him about his aunt May Parker, whom Stark considers attractive, Tony was in fact the only Avenger who believed in Parker and sought out his aid. When Tony was caught up by the terrifying vision of Scarlet Witch, he was possessed and haunted with great fear of losing all his fellow Avengers while he could have done something to save them, and having to live on after they had all been murdered, which was the primary motivator of him starting the Ultron Program. During the Avengers Civil War, however, Tony became distant and hardened towards his former teammates, especially Captain America, for their unwillingness to negotiate or hear the other side's arguments, though he still cared for them. When they fought in Siberia, Tony tried to avoid hurting Rogers, who aggressively protected Bucky Barnes, destroying Tony's arc reactor to do so. Both Stark and Rogers never fully lost their trust in each other, though when they reunited, Stark mercilessly held the rogue Avengers responsible for the schism that had divided the team and left Earth unprepared for Thanos, noting that they had ignored his warnings and obstructed his desire to prepare. Five years later however, Stark abandoned this attitude, noting that resentment was ""corrosive"" and not a feeling he enjoyed."
Robert Downey Jr,"After the Battle of New York, Stark developed a strong fear, that in this new world of ""gods"" and ""aliens,"" he would be unable to protect the ones he loves, which induced him to become paranoid and full of anxiety, which, in turn, influenced Stark to build the first Iron Legion, and then the Ultron AI, so that the only threats against Earth were from Earth itself. His fear gave him something of a perfectionist personality and caused him to so intently focus on issues and problems that he unconsciously ignored other matters around him which led to a strain in his relationship with Pepper Potts and his somewhat negative reputation in the Avengers."
Robert Downey Jr,"Compared to his fellow Avengers, however, Tony was very forward-thinking, always seeing a ""big picture,"" willing to take risks, compromise his morals and dabble in shades of gray to achieve results. As seen with the Sokovia Accords, Stark was willing to endure hardships in the present to build a better future. He was also confident of his ability to negotiate, a belief supported by him negotiating a deal that would have made the Capture of Winter Soldier legal, though he knew that this talent had its limits, expressing regret that he could do nothing to free the rogue Avengers from the Raft. This more nuanced behavior often put him at odds with his fellow Avengers, especially Captain America, who were content with the status quo. Combined with his unpredictability, some people such as Scarlet Witch thought he was destructive, with her believing that Ultron's inability to distinguish between saving the world and destroying it comes from Tony."
Robert Downey Jr,"During times of great stress and frustration, Stark could become very short-tempered and intolerant of those whom he considered his intellectual inferiors for delaying a solution to the problem either mocking/berating them or ignoring them entirely. This behavior extended to both allies and foes."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark was much closer to his mother, Maria Stark, than to his father Howard with whom he had mixed feelings for, as he thought he was ""cold and distant,"" which Nick Fury, however, claimed to be false. He still cared for him a great deal as he wished he could've said goodbye. While he was researching a new element for his Arc Reactor, Tony came across a message left by Howard, telling his son that his “greatest creation” was "
Robert Downey Jr,"Though having learned more of Howard's flaws and shortcomings, Stark still retained lingering issues with his father using his parenting as an excuse for being such a strict mentor to Spider-Man. He was aware of this flaw, however, and consciously attempted to grow out of it. During the Time Heist, after talking with his alternate father Howard and realizing how difficult it was for Howard to raise him due to having an abusive father as well and having had experiences as a father, Tony finally came to reconcile with Howard and even shed his façade temporarily by hugging his father and saying that he loved him"
Robert Downey Jr,"Following the Avengers Civil War, Stark adapted into a new role: that of a mentor to the inexperienced superhero, Spider-Man. He connected with Parker due to the similarities between that of him and Stark, such as their love of science, technology, and heroic deeds, yet Stark was not blind to Spider-Man sharing some of his flaws and does his best to stop him from making the same mistakes Iron Man himself has made in the past. Like most mentors, Stark encourages Parker to be more forward-thinking and imaginative with his abilities while also being conscious of Peter's limitations and wanting to keep him out of fights he felt were too dangerous. Though he could come off as somewhat aloof and detached in his dealings with Spider-Man, this was all done with the intent of making Parker a better superhero than Tony ever was, and after the defeat of Vulture, Stark believed he had succeeded even going so far as to offer the young hero a spot in the Avengers. Some months later, their relationship had strengthened to the point that Stark was openly saddened by Parker's death upon Thanos' completion of the Infinity Gauntlet."
Robert Downey Jr,"Though considered a hobby, obsession or part of his itinerary, Stark considers the relationship between the Iron Man Suit and himself to be symbiotic, in that he and the suit himself are one. By the time of Aldrich Killian's terrorist attack, he had designed 42 variations of the armor as well as having stylized them with their own color designs, personalities, and names. He often referred to his suit as ""he"" when he was remotely controlling it with Potts and exclaimed when the suit's finger was pulled off, claiming it would hurt him. This is further supported during and after the Avengers Civil War whereupon the armors became incredibly streamlined and were designed to emulate a second skin. However, he does claim after the Clean Slate Protocol, that despite being without his suits he is still Iron Man."
Robert Downey Jr,"In spite of his love of the spotlight, the idea of a normal life intrigued Tony greatly as he made attempts to extradite himself from the Iron Man persona and indeed, prior to his involvement in the Infinity War, pondered the possibility of he and Pepper having children together. After the disastrous outcome of the Infinity War, Tony indeed decided to retire and marry Pepper, having a daughter called Morgan Stark. His familial life allowed Tony to find a sense of peace and contentment as a husband and father and this was the primary reason of his refusal to return to being a superhero when presented with a potential chance to undo it all but in the end his guilt over Parker's death allowed him to overcome this and he showed the same amount of selflessness as he had before, willingly sacrificing himself to kill Thanos and his whole army. Despite the agonizing pain he was subjected to as he died, he had accepted his fate, refusing aid and instead finding comfort in the presence of his friends and loved ones, dying with no regrets."
Robert Downey Jr,"Dr. John Dolittle is a veterinarian, who becomes a recluse due to the death of his wife. but is forced to go on a journey to find a cure for the queen. He gains an apprentice named Tommy Stubbins and encounters more animals and adversaries."

Robert Downey Jr,Dolittle re-opens the doors to his sanctuary now including Stubbins.
Chris Hemsworth,"Kevin clearly isn't the brightest, but he makes up for it in his looks. He is known for confusing relatively simple things, such as sight and sound."
Chris Hemsworth,"Being bullied all of his life, Rowan has a deep resentment for all of humanity."
Chris Hemsworth,"Before his banishment to Earth, Thor was initially conceited, arrogant, immature and stubborn. He had proven to be bloodthirsty and enjoyed the challenge of battle and combat, Laufey even stated on Johutenheim that he craved war, with the Frost Giants in particular, due to being Odin's own wars with them convincing him that they were vicious monsters. This bloodlust began as early as his childhood, with Thor then jesting that he'd hunt down the Frost Giants and slay them all if he became king. His adoptive brother Loki even commented that Thor would have killed the entire race of Frost Giants with his bare hands as an adult. However, it should be noted that Thor still had some honorable traits, as he notably supported his friend Sif in her goals to become a great warrior, while most others would not take her seriously. In his heart, he only wishes to live up to the expectations of his father to become a great king but, in truth, he did have difficulty finding the difference between a ruler and a warrior and what makes each a good man."
Chris Hemsworth,"Thor was quick to anger and could act rashly to a situation such as when Asgard was broken into his first instinct was to attack the Johtuns to dissuade them to ever do a similar stunt again. Later on, he, Sif and the Warriors Three launched an all-out attack on Jotunheim, ignoring the fact that they'd be sorely outnumbered which seems to stem from arrogance, although at the time he only went to achieve answers on how they infiltrated Asgard. When the Frost Giants had ruined his coronation, he reacted by angrily flipping over a table and finally when he was later insulted by a Frost Giant on Jotunheim, Thor reacted by promptly decapitating the former with Mjølnir and started a fight with the other Frost Giants"
Chris Hemsworth,"Due to coming from royalty and spending all of his life in Asgard, Thor was out of place in Midgard as his boisterous personality was often part of his charm in Asgard and he was unaware of the customs and norms on Earth. For instance, when he had smashed a cup of a drink that he liked while bellowing ""another"" (thinking it appropriate in Earth), demanded a horse at a pet store and walked in the middle of a street. His vocabulary and terms of endearment were also antiquated and out of place in the modern times, he was trapped within, baffling everyone around him and leading them to believe he was delusional even though it was simply how people spoke upon Asgard. After returning to arrest Loki, Thor had seemed to gain tact but still thought that Bilgesnipe were existent on Earth. In addition, Thor was shown to initially be quite vain and egotistical. For example, while being restrained by doctors and guards at a hospital, he describes himself as ""mighty"". He was also left dumbfounded when he found himself restrained only claiming in disbelief that ""it's not possible"" due to never losing a battle beforehand with his godlike powers."
Chris Hemsworth,"When his irresponsibility and arrogance placed his home Asgard and the Nine Realms in danger, his father, Odin, banished Thor to Earth and stripped him of all his powers. That, in addition to him discovering that he was no longer worthy of Mjølnir's power, put Thor into a state of depression. This, along with Loki lying that Odin died, humbled him greatly and during his time on Midgard, fell in love with the human Jane Foster which finally taught him the humility and wisdom he was lacking. Hence, after his adoptive brother Loki sent the Destroyer to kill him, Thor defended the Warriors Three and the townspeople of New Mexico and selflessly gave up his own life for the town, thereby finally became worthy of Mjølnir again. After regaining his power, Thor would take too often holding back his great powers, unless battling an opponent of equivalent strength and durability, which Thor notably holding back in all of his duels with Loki, believing tha""[his] brother was still in there somewhere""."
Chris Hemsworth,"Thor, however, did still appear to be somewhat hot-tempered, as when he met with Iron Man for the first time, the two battled in the woods, with Thor then proceeding to charge at Captain America, when the latter intervened. However, he quickly came to see that he and the other Avengers were fighting for the same cause and befriended them, notably saving Black Widow from an enraged Hulk."
Chris Hemsworth,"At this time, Thor would become far more responsible than before, since as soon as the Bifrost was regenerated by energy from the Tesseract, Thor took it upon himself to safeguard the worlds of the Nine Realms that had fallen into chaos and conflict in the Asgardians' absence. Following losing Foster after the Bifrost destruction, Thor also became somewhat somber and Sif herself noticed this personality shift from how he used to celebrate all night long to simply staring idly at the ongoing feast of his friends. Thor has learned from his mistakes and has grown to such lengths that he surpassed Loki and even Odin. He was willing to commit treason and spare his enemies if it was honorable as he destroyed the Bifrost to spare Jotunheim and free Loki, going against the Allfather by taking the Aether to Svartalfheim to destroy Malekith as Odin's way would result in countless of Asgardians' death."
Chris Hemsworth,"While Thor was destined to become the King of Asgard, however, he eventually realized, that he couldn't actively protect the Nine Realms from the throne, and selflessly denied his birthright, even offering Mjølnir to (who he thought was) Odin. After helping the Avengers defeat Ultron, Thor temporarily left his friends, taking it upon himself to find the rest of the Infinity Stones and learn the identity of the ultimate enemy"
Chris Hemsworth,"Whatever remained of Thor's boastful personality has seemingly vanished since Odin's death and Hela destroying Mjølnir. Without an object to channel his supernatural powers, even though he retained his immense superhuman might, and with the guilt of having failed to save his father, Thor believed he was worthless which made any remains of arrogance that he had completely disappeared, as can be seen with his interactions towards people have become more awkward and overly-excitable such as when he realized that Brunnhilde was a Valkyrie on Sakaar, he tried to explain and convince her to join him rather than ordering her like he would have done with any other Asgardians. Nevertheless, while Thor's arrogance has disappeared fully, he still remains utmostly confident and assured in his abilities as a warrior, as can be witnessed when he told Grandmaster to “point [him] in the direction of whoever's ass [he] has to kick,” despite his champion being praised as a savage opponent. The knowledge of how Asgard realse to power further humbled Thor even more, as he was shocked and dismayed of his father's war seeking past. Although his love and respect for Odin remained as high as ever, he has come to accept that Odin's darker nature indirectly caused Ragnarok and openly admitted that Odin had flaws in his own right, even saying that Hela had a right to be angry with Odin. Though Thor has mostly unlocked the full magnitude of his powers since Asgard's destruction and Hela's defeat there still remains an awkwardness to his character, especially when compared to his previous personality. During his original coronation, he yelled uproariously towards his subjects in a victorious manner but when ascending to King of Asgard he only awkwardly waved to the Asgardians behind him."
Chris Hemsworth,"After Thanos attacked and massacred half of his kind, with only he himself as the only known survivor of the half that was slaughtered by Thanos, and witnessing Loki's death, Thor was greatly saddened and left furious by having lost his brother who he had just reconciled with and the deaths of the Asgardians and gained a strong desire to kill Thanos to avenge his people and brother, which he vowed to do so to the Titan, although Thanos was not fazed and simply taunted him that Loki is truly dead. Out of all the deaths of the Asgardians, Thor is particularly riddled with grief and anger over the deaths of his family and to a lesser degree, Heimdall, who Thor considered his best friend, and he lamented the fact that he is the sole survivor and only surviving legacy of the Asgardian Royal Family so strongly that he showed some sadness when talking to Hela, who had ruthlessly tried to kill him and even cried upon talking about Odin, Frigga and Loki. Although he retains much of his old personality, Thor has become noticeably more somber and sullen. He also seems to have gained a new perspective on why he had prevailed over the countless enemies he faced, as rather than saying it was due to his immense power and prowess as a warrior, Thor somewhat humbly said to Rocket that he believed he is only alive because fate wants it. His resentment for Thanos even made him about to attack Gamora when he learned she is Thanos' daughter, although he remains fully reasonable even with those connected to Thanos, as he went as far as to calmly talk about his own family problems with her. Having nothing more to lose, Thor valiantly and did everything he could to kill Thanos to avenge his people and family, with him going as far as to single-handedly bravely confront and wound Thanos with Stormbreaker, coming the closest to winning against Thanos. He even showed some sadism when he mocked Thanos that he had ignored Thor's promise to kill him and that caused him to be now seemingly beaten, having intentionally intended to wound Thanos first and gloat before killing him, but this proved to be a fatal mistake that Thor would deeply regret, as the blow was not sufficient to hinder Thanos, who successfully utilized the brief moment to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe and escape, causing Thor to not only be mocked once again by Thanos, who remained calm even after being wounded but also fail to avenge his people and brother as well as losing more of his friends."
Chris Hemsworth,"Following the Snap, Thor found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that his fatal mistake had resulted in the destruction of half the universe's life forms. He retained a glimmer of hope, however, and immediately voted in favor of Carol Danvers' plan to claim the Infinity Stones and bring everyone back. During the confrontation, he actually seemed to have taken the Mad Titan's taunts to heart, immediately cutting off the Infinity Gauntlet to prevent him from utilizing it. However, upon discovering that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones his wounds only deepen with shame and remorse and he kills the Mad Titan without hesitation shortly afterwards, finally avenging the death of his people. However, this brought Thor no semblance of peace at all."
Chris Hemsworth,"Even five years after Thanos' death, Thor still continued to be haunted by his failure to stop the Titan and suffered in the belief that he had not been able to embody the qualities of an ideal king that had been imbued into him throughout his entire childhood. Still, he unsuccessfully tried to keep up a façade of still being his former self and initially refused to assist in the Time Heist. However, all this changed upon seeing his mother, Frigga, again, who told him he had indeed failed and that this made him just like anyone else; finally lifting the burden of having to be an ideal king from his shoulders"
Chris Hemsworth,"Thus; Thor comes to terms with his own mistakes in the realization and acknowledgment that no individual is perfect, not even a king. During the Battle of Earth, Thor bravely faced Thanos alongside his fellow Avengers, displaying no signs of his previous anger towards the Titan. After the Battle, Thor seems to have returned to his former-self and decided to pursue a voyage of self-discovery. He also ceded the throne of New Asgard to Brunnhilde, having made peace with the fact he was not a leader."
Chris Hemsworth,"At some point, Billy found Rose Summerspring on the beach and convinced her to join his cult. After Rose's sister Emily was introduced to the cult, she eventually tried to get Rose away from it."
Chris Hemsworth,"After Emily killed an FBI agent who thought Emily was taking Rose hostage, Rose contacted Billy, telling him they were at the El Royale hotel. With his cult members Waring ""Wade"" Espiritu, Annabell Czuchlewski, Norris ""Roman"" Kindel, and Chris ""Flicker"" Grimes, Billy arrived at the hotel as Dock O'Kelly and Darlene Sweet were attempting to leave with the money. He captured them, along with Emily."
Chris Hemsworth,"Billy intended to take both the money and a tape incriminating a deceased public figure, and forced Emily and Miles to play roulette, in which he would kill the loser. He killed Emily when she lost, but before the next round, the power went out due to a storm."
Chris Hemsworth,"Unimpressed by Darlene's singing, Billy attempted to make her and Dock play roulette next, but Dock attacked him before they could. Billy was about to kill Dock when Miles, revealed to be a sniper from the Vietnam War, pointed his gun at him, and after a few moments, shot Billy in the head, and quickly killed the other cult members except Rose, who avenged Billy's death by stabbing miles and was in turn killed by Dock."
Chris Hemsworth,"In 2016, He and High T were assigned to go to the Eiffel Tower in Paris to stop an parasitic alien known as the Hive. While en route, the two agent met a couple and ordered them to leave but not before wiping their memory with a neuralyzer. Heading up to the main tower base, he and T were confronted the Hive.

For 4 years, H was a known around MiB as one of the most best agent in the organization unaware of his boss's new nature. H himself never really felt like himself ever since the mission and constantly became more arrogant and lazy on his job. He never got fired since High T always covered for him."
Chris Hemsworth,"In 2019, H was on a case which involved him going undercover as a gambler. Playing a game with an alien drug dealer, H's cover was blown and he was forced to subdue all of the henchmen, however he was bitten by a poisonous snake. Knowing that the drug dealer (who was also bitten by the snake) had the antidote, he pleaded with the alien's servant to give him the serum, agreeing to sleep with the alien. Leaving the hotel, H made his way back to MiB headquarters where he walks in late in a meeting with High T. T assigns H to look out for the Jababian royal family member Vungus. H however meets young probationary Agent M, who managed to get herself to assist H on his mission. Taking a trip to London, H and and M went undercover and found Vungus at an alien dance club.

While M covers for Vungus, H use all sorts of weaponry to fight the twins, finally taking them out with a rocket. Vungus succumbs to his wounds and MiB later comes to investigate the scene."
Chris Hemsworth,"Back at MiB, M is able to convince T and Agent C that they need them to solve the mysterious case around Vungus's death, saying that there might be a mole in MiB. H is demoted to desk duty, however he is able to convince M to follow a lead in Marrakesh. There they run into Nasr and Bassam, who reveal that H relationship with Riza. Going to an alien workshop, they recover Pawny, the last known survivor form an attack from the Twins. Heading back outside they encounter MiB agents who were sent by High T, who convinced by Agent C believes that M and H might be the mole due to surveillance cameras showing Vungus passing a unknown crystal to M. M and H split in different directions, where H gets a super powered bike from Nasr and Bassam. H rescue M from the twins and use a red button to then escape from MiB. Stranded in the desert, H and M learn the the mysterious crystal the Vungus had was actually a weapon powered by a blue giant star. The weapon is later stolen from Bassan who plans to sell it to Riza."
Chris Hemsworth,"Late at night H and M are able to get the rocket powered bike working and plan to infiltrate Riza's Base. H provide a distraction by flirting with Riza, but Riza quickly calls the ruse, knowing that he is here for the weapon. H gets in a fight with Riza bodyguard Luca, who easily overpowers him. Taking him to Riza, she order him and M to be killed. However, M realises that Luca is in fact the alien she helped escaped 23 years ago when she was a child. Luca returns the favor by allowing H and M to go free with the crystal. Walking H reveal to M and that his real name is Henry. The trio are soon surrounded by the Twins who demand that they hand over the crystal weapons but are killed by High T and other MiB agents. T congratulates M and H and the case is closed. Back at MiB headquarters, H and M realize that something is off, when they deduce that the twins were actually against the Hive instead of being for the Hive as they previously suspected. They reveal to C that High T is actually the mole and that he is infected with the Hive. Taking a rocket powered car to the Eiffel Tower, M realises in front H that High T must have nerualyzed him so he wouldn't get in the way of their plan."
