Ben Kingsley,"Originally born in captivity in the menagerie of the Rajah of Oodeypore, India, Bagheera began to pine for his freedom after he ran away with his friends. Once he was mature and strong enough he broke the lock on his cage and escaped into the jungle, where his ferocity and cunning won him the respect of all its other inhabitants, except Shere Khan the tiger (likely out of his arrogance). Bagheera revealed all this to Mowgli later. None but Mowgli ever learned that Bagheera once wore a collar and chain, explaining the cat's special insight concerning Men."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is presented as a wise figure. Level-headed and intelligent, the panther is amongst the most down-to-earth residents of the jungle. When first introduced, he is seen as a selfless and caring individual, rescuing the orphaned Mowgli, and going out of his way to ensure his safety from that moment forward. Although he cares a great deal about the man-cub, Bagheera is also easily frustrated and intolerable of tomfoolery. This would result in rather heated arguments against the two, specifically in regards to whether or not Mowgli should remain in the jungle or return to the Man Village to live amongst his own species. Bagheera's temper can occasionally blind his sense of judgment, resulting in careless behavior such as abandoning Mowgli in the jungle despite the knowing dangers that lurk. Nevertheless, he is quick to reform and repeatedly finds himself by Mowgli's side once again. He is a devoted ally and makes it a crucial objective to protect those he cares about."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is also commonly known as the foil of Baloo the bear, whom the former views as a ""stupid, jungle bum"". The two have opposite personalities, and continuously annoy one another with their need to push their own personal opinions onto each other. Nevertheless, these conflicts mostly centered around Mowgli's fate, and the two generally share a brotherly bond. Following the climax, when it appeared Baloo had met his demise, Bagheera revealed that he truly did care for the bear, and was notably embarrassed to see that Baloo had overheard his heartfelt eulogy. Once Mowgli made the decision to return to the Man Village, Bagheera and Baloo joyfully returned to their lives in the jungle, setting aside their differences and remained together as best friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Prior to his accident, Strange had a massive ego and pride that fueled his career. As a result, Strange only took on patients that he believed would help benefit his status, even refusing to heal a U.S. Army Colonel's back, albeit it was because this injury was a simple one any neurosurgeon can fix. His work was also driven by a desire to control death and time, which led him to refuse even looking into any patient he perceived to have little chance of recovery to avoid ruining his track record. However, if he also perceived the chance a patient could survive, he would help them recover even if it would not benefit his public image, showing that at his core, he does care about saving people. In addition, he seemed to prioritize his research over his physician work, as he stated his work would save thousands for years to come, whereas a physician would only save a handful of patients that they'd have to directly interact with. This, however, changed after his accident, which left Strange a broken man and constantly frustrated due to being incapable of returning to the life he knew. Upon visiting Kamar-Taj, Strange initially maintained his narrow-minded arrogance and stubbornly refused to believe that the Ancient One was telling the truth until she forcibly demonstrated astral projection and sent him across multiple dimensions to prove her point."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange has shown extreme determination and stubbornness, a useful trait in a doctor as he would never give up on his patients, even when one was called dead with a bullet in his brain. Also, Strange was able to determine the patient was still alive to successfully save him. He spent most of his remaining money in seven different surgeries to attempt to heal his hands to the point of near bankruptcy, remained outside of Kamar-Taj's front door for five hours after being initially thrown out, then spent most of his time at Kamar-Taj studying and improving his abilities, even going as far as studying while sleeping through astral projection. He even allowed himself to be violently killed by countless times by Dormammu until he gave in to his demands and later giving up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for saving Tony Stark's life when he was about to be killed by the Mad Titan, even though wanted to save the Time Stone first. Despite his determined and stubborn attitude, Strange has shown to be the voices of reason to those around him."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his training with the Ancient One, Strange gained a newfound appreciation for the natural order of things due to his studies of the Mystic Arts and became more humble. However, this was not to say he was a completely changed man; he retained a cocky attitude when dealing with people and things, as seen in how he behaved when he went to borrow books from Wong. This, coupled with his inquisitiveness and willingness to break rules, made him an odd one in Kamar-Taj and constantly an annoyance to many of his peers. However, due to this nature of his, he was also more willing to compromise and be somewhat flexible with his principles, quickly accepting that the Ancient One broke her own rules to do what was deemed necessary to protect the world, and he had to be willing to do so himself, which, when combined with his natural talent in the Mystic Arts, had the Ancient One name him as the new Master of the New York Sanctum, despite his relative lack of training and inexperience."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Having trained as a doctor, Strange is a pacifist as he tries to avoid in killing and physically harming people, as it goes against the Hippocratic oath. He was disgusted by his actions in killing Lucian Aster, stating he became a doctor to save lives, not take them. However, neither the Ancient One nor Karl Mordo was especially sympathetic towards this, with the former stating it was his towering ego and delusion that he could control death itself that made him become a doctor and the latter simply calling him a coward for not having the spine to do what has to be done. Nevertheless, Strange claimed that there were other ways to defeat their enemies, a claim he ultimately proved correct by defeating Dormammu without killing him. However, overtime, Strange has come to terms that he would have to forsaken his pacifist in killing and physically harming people in order to do what's right, but it mostly shows that he did grow a spine in order to do what needed to be done. Strange even goes to the point of not caring what happens to anyone that has mental and physical issues, as shown when he was going to allow a group of villains from different universes with their own Spider-Men to return to their universes and meet their fates instead of helping them, which goes against his nature as a doctor, although his intentions were to preserve the safety of the Multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Despite coming off as arrogant and genuinely selfish, Strange does have good intentions and is open-minded. Also, Strange shows loyalty to those he considers his allies or friends and would help them in anyway he could. Strange has even shown an emotional side, especially when it comes to those who are closes to him, as he nearly broke down after the Ancient One's death, saying goodbye to Christine Palmer, the prospect of losing his memory of Peter Parker, seeing the memory of Palmer giving him his watch and having to recall his sister's death. In addition, Strange would show a soft spot for orphaned children or teenagers, as he showed this to Spider-Man and America Chavez. However, Strange's greatest strength is his flexibility, as shown when he used the time stone to give himself and Mordo a second chance in stopping the Hong Kong Sanctum from getting destroyed by Kaecilius and letting Dormammu into their universe. Strange also willing help Thor locate Odin so he and Loki would return to Asgard, in spite of his mistrust."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"During his talk with Kaecilius, Strange began to see his own failings reflected in him and started showing signs of self-improvement, as shown when he expressed a newfound trust in Nicodemus West. Also, during his talk with the Ancient One before her death, he admitted that his fear of failure is what pushed him to be a successful neurosurgeon. In addition, Strange has confessed to his alternate self and later to another universe Christine Palmer, that the reason why he often comes off as aloof and arrogant, as well as controlling and sometimes paranoid is due to his childhood trauma of having to watch his younger sister drown because he was unable to do anything to save her. The sense of helplessness that he felt that day has developed into a need to always keep everything under control, due to his own fear of ever having to go through such trauma again. Strange also developed a fear of losing those who are closes to him. In addition, Strange seems to have a severe case of misophonia, meaning he is greatly distracted by even the slightest sound when he requires absolute focus. This was shown when he was operating on a patient and asked West to cover his watch as the ticking was distracting him, this even extended to his performing of spells, as Spider-Man's constant chattering in an attempt to make alterations to his spell distracted him and made him lose control of it and break open the multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his fear of losing those who are closes to him, Strange tries not to hurt or damage the lives of those around him, as shown when he was reluctant to tell his friends and fellow superheroes, especially Stark, the outcome against Thanos as he hoped for another way to defeat him until he realized that there wasn't and had no choice but to make sure the only victory against the mad titan would happen and how he hesitated and got emotional in going through with the spell that would make himself and the world forget Peter Parker. However, Strange has been secretly blaming himself for sacrificing Stark's life as he felt responsible for how the lives of his friends and allies got damaged because of his actions, even though his efforts saved the universe. This was shown when Strange felt at fault for Parker's identity as Spider-Man getting exposed by one of his enemies and ruining his life, which contributed to his decision to help the boy. Strange also showed remorse and sympathized with Wanda Maximoff as he feels guilty, because he gave Thanos the Time Stone, that she had to kill someone she loved to stop the mad titan, but it turned out to be for nothing, created a hex in a town, got corrupted by the Darkhold and became the Scarlet Witch. However, Strange's guilt was mostly because he had come to see Stark and Parker as his friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Although he has a good heart, Strange has shown to get easily annoyed and frustrated with everyone around him, especially his friends and allies, as he can be harsh and would lose his temper with them at times. Also, Strange has let his pride get the better of him, as he would place the blame on others instead of taking responsibility for his actions and mistakes. This is shown when Strange blamed Palmer, West and other doctors for ruining his life because he wouldn't accept the fact that the car accident was caused by his carelessness and lack of regard for his safety, and Parker for botching up the spells that was meant to help restore his secret identity as Spider-Man, even though they were both to blame for the incident. Also, Strange can sound heartless whenever he was upset and doesn't listen to reason, even when his friends or allies call him out for his behavior, as seen when he wasn't fazed when Parker told him to have a heart. However, despite his annoyances, frustration and pride, Strange does understand that those around him had good intentions and their hearts were in the right place. Also, Strange would make an honest effort in making amends for his actions and mistakes, especially if he realized how badly he messed up, hurt and pushed those he cares about away."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After taking his talk with the Ancient One to the heart, Strange showed strong selflessness, as seen during his battle with Dormammu, allowing himself to be killed over and over in order to keep Dormammu trapped in the time loop so mankind could live and let go of his fear of failure. Also, through the alternate Palmer's encouragement, Strange decided to put his other fears behind him, although he would always have his fear of losing those who are closes to him. However, despite demonstrating tremendous maturity, Strange does maintains some of his old habits such as making sarcastic comments and jokes when talking to others, similar to Iron Man and Peter Quill. He also retains his meticulous and diligence by forming a watchlist of individuals that might pose a threat to Earth, such as Loki."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange's imagination and intellect have given him a vastly flexible personality, so much so the Ancient One could never see exactly what his future would be, only possible paths he would take. Due to his inquisitiveness, Strange is easily able to adapt and teach himself light years ahead of even experienced sorcerers like Mordo and Kaecilius. Once he started to get the hang of his sorcery studies, he began to teach himself and was able to learn at an accelerated rate. Also, through his intelligence, Strange is able to imagine unorthodox solutions to problems, even when he lacked experience of using powerful magical relics. After his car crash, Strange's hands suffered from constant shaking, but it faded overtime, due to his training as a sorcerer. Strange even refused to direct magic into his body to heal his hands like Jonathan Pangborn did with his legs, presumably to be reminded of his mistakes in the past that led him to leave his old life as a neurosurgeon behind and the beginning of his new one as a sorcerer/superhero."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Shere Khan is known throughout the entire jungle as a tiger without mercy as well as being ruthless, sadistic, psychopathic, arrogant, hateful, power-hungry, and hypocritical, who mainly kills for his own pleasure instead of survival. His most defining personality trait is his unbounded hatred towards mankind, possibly due to a previous encounter with them, and was willing to break the law of the jungle to satisfy his thirst for their blood. He always makes grand gestures about the ever-changing nature of the jungle, ranting to Akela how he allowed the man to live among the inhabitants. However, he was also incapable to think that perhaps he was also one of the reasons that the humans are cruel towards their environment."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"ike his previous versions, The Grinch started out as a cranky, grumpy, solitary, and selfish creature who likes to bully and antagonize the citizens of Whoville whenever he can. He takes some sadistic pride in his work, sees an artistry and style to being generally mean and nasty."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"However, deep down, he has a soft spot as he shows to his dog Max and a select few individuals that manage to appeal to it under his rough exterior."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After learning the true meaning of Christmas, he redeemed himself and realize that he wasn't alone anymore, because of Cindy Lou's kindness."
Chris Evans,"Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Rogers has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original values and character. Since his reawakening, Rogers was saddened by losing so much of his time, but still retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. He was also very empathetic; being able to understand and relate to both Wamda and Pietro Maximoff before meeting them and understanding Tony Stark's motivation during the Avengers Civil War, despite Iron Man being on the opposing side. He also conceded that Stark had very good reasons not to join the Time Heist and openly said he was happy that his friend had finally found the peace that he'd so desperately wanted."
Chris Evans,"What separates Steve Rogers from the other Avengers is two things: his humanity and morality. Steve Rogers is an extremely dedicated person. Despite originally being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of service to his country in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the war effort by starring in propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Barnes, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Rogers disobeyed his superior's orders and went behind enemy lines in an apparent suicide mission and rescued them. Rogers finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, and does not hesitate to stand up to corrupt politicians, hypocritical authority figures, powerful beings like Loki, or even the nearly omnipotent Thanos. His determination also aids him, giving him a boost in physical power to allow him to hold off beings of much greater strength, with this even allowing him to survive against Thanos. A true hero, Rogers is more than willing to sacrifice himself to protect others and does not care if he is considered the villain in his heroic job, as his desire to protect the innocent remained as strong as ever, even after he was deemed a criminal. Though he refused to give up in the immediate aftermath of the Snap, following the disastrous Ambush on Thanos, even Rogers conceded defeat. When Scott Lang returned however, Rogers quickly got his fighting spirit back, being the first to support Scott's plan. The true extent of his determination and selfless heroism was fully exemplified when he finally proved himself worthy to wield Mj������������������lnir. Amusingly however, when facing off with his past self, Rogers ac"
Chris Evans,"Captain America's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness often puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a grey morality to protect people. This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. This difference in attitude, reached a head in the Avengers Civil War, where Tony sought to compromise with governments who were increasingly intolerant with collateral damage, while Rogers refused to do so, believing it would inhibit the Avengers' response time, eventually causing him to become a fugitive. Rogers nevertheless still cared for Tony and did not desire for them to fight, as he pleaded with Tony to stop attacking Bucky, as the latter did it without having control and did not kill him after beating him, even going as far as to send him a letter to apologize and a phone so Stark can contact him. He was visibly ashamed when Tony demanded him to tell the truth of his parents' death, and felt enough sympathy and remorse for keeping the truth hidden that he relinquished his shield and returned it to the Stark family. Two years later, after much of the anger between the two factions of Avengers had died down, Rogers outright referred to Iron Man as Earth's ""best defender,"" even joking that he himself was a poor substitute emphasizing the respect he maintained for Tony."
Chris Evans,"While Captain America's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought to be a dead best friend, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship. This reached its apex in the Avengers Civil War, where Steve steadfastly refused to give up on Bucky, which caused the Avengers to fracture along with more than half their number to become fugitives."
Chris Evans,"Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone, or greatly aged. Even while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new complicated world. Although he eventually reunited with both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a ""man out of time."" However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of the second incarnation of the Avengers."
Chris Evans,"He is very protective of his friends from his past, especially Bucky Barnes, and is willing to go to great lengths to save them, being susceptible to emotional and violent acts to fulfill his goal. He seems to have developed a trust and attraction towards Sharon Carter. During his time with the new team of Avengers, he developed a trust and bond with Black Widow. He also embraces links to his own time, often seeing much of Howard Stark in Tony. He is also very selfless and is willing to risk his life for his teammates, such as when he jumped in to save Black Widow from Proxima Midnight, without knowing he would be strong enough to hold back her spear."
Chris Evans,"He does have a darker side, however, with Ultron noting that Rogers had been a soldier for so long, he subconsciously craved conflict and battles to avoid a civilian life and being forced to confront all he lost. Indeed, his worst nightmare, caused by Maximoff. Maximoff, was shown to be the end of the war, with people not needing him anymore, leaving him with one hollow realization: everyone whom he had ever loved was gone, and he was alone. Overall, Rogers is a selfless person but one with a notable blind spot: his childhood friend Bucky Barnes. The last living link to his time, Rogers was willing to do everything to protect him, going so far as to abandon his role as leader of the Avengers and a team player. When Tony called Rogers out on failing the role of Captain America, at the end of their fight during the Avengers Civil War, Rogers abandoned his shield and with it, the identity of ""Captain America,"" heeding Tony's point. Even years later, he had made no efforts to reclaim the moniker allowing his uniform to darken and removing the American stars that had once adorned it."
Chris Evans,"Rogers has a strong dislike for agencies or groups that express control over the individual, due to having fought vigorously for his nations' freedom and losing the world he knew for that very reason. This dislike extends to groups of any ideology be they HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., or even America's own government. Rogers himself admits that the Howling Commandos committed less than moral actions during World War II, but it was for the basis that people could be free, whereas Project Insight was using fear to dissuade a national security risk before it happens, eliminating the need for a soldier like himself and taking away the American people's freedom. The desire for free will heavily influenced Rogers' opinion on the Sokovia Accords. He strongly believed that the extravagant politics involved would restrict (or at least hinder) the Avengers' efforts to protect innocent people, putting him at odds with the very pragmatic Tony Stark on the issue. His opinion on such groups lessened, when the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre locked up Barnes in a cage. In the end, such was his dislike that he cut all ties with them and became a fugitive after the Avengers Civil War. While he still retains his desire to protect the innocent, he has no desire to be re-acknowledged as a superhero and does not care about the opinions of government bodies, as he coldly told Thaddeus Ross that he did not care if the latter disapproves of him and even went as far as to say he would not hesitate to fight him if he got in his way."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy is fiercely optimistic and independent. Since childhood, she had harbored a dream to become a police officer, to make the world a better place. She cares for the well-being of others, and is always willing to extend a helping hand."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Due to being a rabbit, a species not known for being police officers, Judy faced continuous doubt from those around her, from her parents to local bullies. Nevertheless, she used this doubt as a means to increase her determination; she believed in the importance of always trying and making an effort to reach her goals, one of which was to eventually become a police officer of Zootopia, a city where predator and prey supposedly live together in peace and harmony, believing she will be quickly accepted amongst her peers. Unfortunately, she was too idealistic in this regard and found herself unprepared when facing the reality that city had both positive and negative aspects including prejudice, stereotyping, and profiling."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Unfortunately, Judy's fierce determination, at times, causes her to be overconfident and impulsive. She is shown to leap into action without always taking the time to fully think things through. This leads her to: abandon her post on parking duty to pursue Duke Weaselton into Little Rodentia causing considerable mayhem; almost get herself fired by taking on the Otterton case without permission; stake her career on being able to solve that case in 48 hours before learning that she has no resources; threaten to expose Mr. Big to his face which leads to him deciding to ice her and Nick; steal an entire train car full of evidence, rather than simply taking some key evidence to the ZPD. This leads to them nearly crashing into another train and ultimately destroying almost all the evidence."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Despite the odds, Judy remains optimistic and determined, adapting herself to the environment of Zootopia and those around her to build up both the way she presents herself and pursue her goals. She is clever, kind, and resourceful, which proves to be her greatest asset. She tarnishes the stereotype of a ""dumb bunny"", being intelligent enough to outsmart professional con artist, Nick Wilde, several times. Months of training at the Zootopia Police Academy has also left her tactical, with an impressive amount of physical prowess. During times of chaos, she can quickly take charge of a situation by concocting an efficient plan on the spot, being daring enough to take dangerous chances, in order to potentially end the day victorious. More often than not, Judy comes out successful as a result of this."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy believes that predators and prey should be treated equally and works to follow that belief. However, due to her childhood experience, having been bullied, attacked and injured by a fox, Judy harbors a degree of unconscious fear of predators (mainly foxes), such that while she is aware that predators don't pose a threat, there is a small part of her that does believe they could revert to their primitive savage ways."
Jack Black,"Po is usually easygoing, playful, and cocky like a big kid, as well as rather ""fanboyish"" when expressing his love for kung fu. In the first film, he is seen as a huge kung fu fan, owning posters and action figures of his favorite warriors, but is himself clumsy, portly, and having low self-confidence, only dreaming he could be a great warrior while feeling stuck in his unfulfilling life at his father's noodle shop. But when given the chance, he is all too eager to learn kung fu the hard way, enduring physical beatings and insults in hopes of changing who he is. After learning that ""there is no secret ingredient"", Po shows the inner strength to save the Valley of Peace by using his own skills and ingenuity and in the end becomes his own hero."
Jack Black,"Po possesses a kind and selfless nature, and is generally friendly and laid back. He also has a strong sense of justice, and is willing to risk his life to protect others. Though immature and oblivious in some situations, Po is able to take things seriously when it is called for, and is not hesitant to accept heavy responsibility-at times taking on more than he can handle. He is also capable of learning things very quickly with the right motivation, as shown in the first film, and has memorized a vast amount of knowledge about kung fu, even being reliable enough to teach a class on his own."
Jack Black,"Po also displays an action-craving attitude along with a natural affinity for humor, and isn't above acting clownish and dishing out quips, even making fun of himself, in order to entertain others. Imaginative and adventurous, he continues to act excitable and marvel over his heroes even after he has become the Dragon Warrior, at times leaving them embarrassed by his behavior. As Po tends to be less serious and disciplined than other masters, he also tends to think more outside the box, and will find different, creative ways to solve a problem if need be. Po has also broken some rules and traditions (as well as still having a habit of breaking physical things), though this is often unintentional. Po's lack of discipline and flippant personality often give him an unintentional advantage over his enemies, since, combined with his appearance, it causes them to disregard him or struggle to take him seriously, so they are often shocked when he proves to be a tenacious and incredibly skilled warrior."
Jack Black,"One of the recurring plot lines in the television series is Po's struggle to not let his title affect his ego. Throughout the series, he is shown to have many adoring fans and he welcomes the attention, occasionally to the point that it begins to negatively impact his duties or those around him. Despite this, he also possesses the self-awareness to realize when he has made a mistake, and is willing to accept responsibility for his actions."
Jack Black,"Though having grown more confident since becoming the Dragon Warrior, Po nevertheless has moments of intimidation and self-doubt. Even as he tries to talk tough, this boisterous behavior tends to become more comical than threatening, and is perhaps a front for the panda's insecurities. Despite this, Po does have a sense of dignity and defiance, as shown in the first film when he argued with Master Shifu as he tried to leave the palace, and in the second film when he argued with Tigress in order to seek out Shen."
Jack Black,"In the third film, as Po is continuously pushed to his limits, first by Shifu making him the Master of the Furious Five and then the arrival of Kai and subsequent defeat of most of his friends, as well as having found his biological father and having to please both him and Ping, Po finally starts to reveal how for all his light-heartedness and optimism, he is not without limits. While confident in his fighting ability, Po is forced to reflect inwardly and rely on his mind and spirit in order to fully understand himself and, therefore, master Chi. He approached the challenge enthusiastically and diligently, but displayed anger, frustration, and doubt when Li admitted to lying. Po was quick to forgive his father, and, quickly adapts to his circumstances to defeat Kai."
Jack Black,"Po has not only matured since his days before learning kung fu, but his unlikely triumph as the Dragon Warrior has changed those around him. Simple, good-natured, and fueled by determination, Po has never held grudges, not even against those who doubt him or treat him with contempt, and is selfless when it comes to protecting those in need, even being able to show compassion for his enemies. Po is much like the opposite of the foes he faces, such as Tai Lung, Shen, and Kai, in that he shows light-heartedness and humility instead of arrogance and desire for more power. It is these qualities, as well as his great respect for kung fu and his loving heart, that mark Po as the Dragon Warrior, able to defeat such villains when no one else could."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is an exceptional and intelligent scientist on par with Hank Pym enough for the latter to consider him his rival. He, however, resented Pym for his ego and attempt to fire him. From this point on, he develops a fierce hatred for Pym, deriding his egotistical nature and arrogance. Beyond this resentment for Pym, however, he's rather kind and affectionate, getting along quite well with Scott Lang upon meeting him and commenting on his size-increasing trials in the old days."
Laurence Fishburne,"It is later revealed that Foster deeply cares for Ava Starr, doing whatever he could to heal her of her condition. This love is so deep that he treats Starr like his own daughter, tolerating several of her more ruthless actions, and refused to leave her side, even when his life was at risk. Despite his love for her, Foster's tolerance for her actions has a limit; this is particularly seen when Starr suggested kidnapping Lang's daughter. Foster vehemently rejected the idea, going so far as to say if she laid one finger on her, he would no longer help her. Despite Starr's attempt to push him away, Foster could not turn his back to her and decided to go off the grid with her."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is shown to be a loyal and devoted friend, as it was his friendship with Elihas Starr that drove him to try to help Ava in the first place and having been good friends with Janet van Dyne, her and Elihas's fates being among the prominent reasons why he resented Hank, with Foster indicating that he had tried to persuade Janet to avoid being with Hank and regretting his failure that caused her seeming death, Foster, despite at first dismissing the potential that Janet would be ripped apart if he extracted her quantum energy, eventually came to hesitate doing so out of concern of what would happen to his former colleague at the last moment, worrying that Pym may have been correct about van Dyne being ripped apart by the process, and urged Starr to find another way. Even with all that had happened between him and Hank, Foster never wanted him dead, as he did not allow Ava to kill Hank in her search for more quantum energies and was concerned when Hank feigned a heart attack. They eventually achieved a reconciliation of sorts, as Foster came to trust that Hank would help in Ava's recovery after he had saved Janet."
Marion Cotillard,"An idealist, Sofia believes she can better the world through her work at Abstergo[4] and seeks to eradicate humanity's violent impulses using science and the Pieces of Eden. In doing so, she hopes to create a more peaceful society."
Marion Cotillard,"A hard working scientist above all, she could be quite distant at times and often disregarded giving credit to others, such as taking credit for the Animus 4.3 concept art conceived by Layla Hassan."
Marion Cotillard,"Her relationship with her father Alan Rikkin was difficult and estranged most of the time; where he sought to contain the Assassin threat, she only sought to contain violence itself."
Michael Fassbender,"Affected by the death of his mother, Callum grew up with a disdain for violence against women. On one occasion he killed a pimp, although such an action would lead to his eventual arrest and death sentence. Callum also initially had no interest in the Assassins' fight and opposed them out of spite for his father."
Michael Fassbender,"After several sessions in the Animus 4.3, Callum developed the Bleeding Effect and saw his ancestor Aguilar as a hallucinatory phantom. When Callum violently desycnhronized from an Animus session, he was left temporarily paralyzed from the waist down."
Michael Fassbender,"Callum's opinion about his father and later, Assassins, changed after he confronted Joseph about Mary's death in which the latter explained that he did what he had to do to prevent the Templars from claiming Aguilar's Apple of Eden (though it was Mary who forced his hand due to his moment of weakness, the same reason he couldn't kill his son). Initially siding with Templars in the search for the Apple of Eden in question, Callum soon understood what Joseph truly felt at the time when relieving the moment his ancestor Aguilar was forced to watch Maria dying during the Templars' betrayal. This, coupled with meeting phantoms of his parents along with those of his parents who inducted him into the Assassins, he eventually embraced his lineage and continued his parents and fellow Assassins' battle against Templars."
Michael Fassbender,"Erik has lived a troubled life, having felt mankind's cruelty not only as a mutant but also as a Jewish person. Erik was forced to watch as his people suffered under the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.[2] He is filled with hatred and anger mainly against Sebastian Shaw, who murdered his mother before his very eyes and forced Erik to experience horrendous tortures."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is absolutely devoted to the cause of protecting mutant kind, refusing to let mutants suffer a similar holocaust. Erik will protect his species at any cost, no matter how many human lives must be sacrificed.[2] His devotion to the cause and the fact that what he says about mankind is often true, many mutants have joined him over the years. He will even sacrifice his fellow mutants, if it will serve the cause, such as the pawns of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Mystique,[3] once he found out about the Sentinels.[4] However, despite his devotion, he refused to put his life on the line unless he had no other choice and was more than willing to sacrifice mutants if it would keep him out of harm's way, forcing Rogue to take his place in a machine that would kill its user and letting the ""pawns"" in his Brotherhood attack Alcatraz first, the former of which Wolverine called him out on saying if he was really righteous he would carry out his plan himself instead of endangering the life of a young girl."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto firmly believes that humans and mutants are not capable of co-existing, and believes mutants to be superior and the next stage in evolution. This conflicts greatly with the beliefs of Professor X, to whom Magneto frequently argues that if action isn't taken to ensure mutants' survival then a holocaust similar to that which he lived through will happen (a fate which indeed came to pass by 2023). He is not, however, above working with the X-Men when the situation calls for it despite the X-Men fighting to protect his enemies in addition to mutants, and when at death's doorstep in 2023 admits that he regrets all the years that he and Charles spent fighting each other despite their difference in goals."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is completely accepting of any and all mutants, regardless of their abilities who they are, what they have done, and their past with him (with the exception of Sebastian Shaw, who started Erik on his dark path by murdering Erik's mother in front of him and then experimenting on him).[1] Erik loves the mutant kind and will never turn away a mutant who wishes to fight for mutant freedom alongside him. In spite of this, Magneto does not seem to truly hate humanity on a fundamental level; he has had relationships with at least two human women, Ms. Maximoff[4] (which, unknown to him, led to the birth of his son Quicksilver) and his wife, Magda, whom he loved dearly.[5] Rather, Magneto hates and fears what humanity can (and in the original timeline, does) do to mutant kind, having survived the holocaust, and he does not wish to see that happen again to his fellow mutants. He is fully aware how cruel humans can be and sees that mutants can be paralleled to the Jewish population under Nazi rule. However, he does view mutants and humans as two very distinct species and does not believe that coexistence is possible.[2][1] He has, however, attempted this as of the revised timeline, which leads to his family being killed, which may have further cemented this belief. He believed Charles is naive and foolish for believing humanity will not always oppress and segregate mutants.[5] It can be argued that Magneto's hatred towards humans can be all in defense of mutant kind."
Michael Fassbender,"Along with standard police training, Hole undertakes specialized training in interrogation techniques and firearms at the FBI. His problematic and often unsocial behavior, as well as his obsessive tendencies during investigations, brings him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues. Bjarne Moller, head of the Oslo Police Department, often shields Hole from being fired, believing he is a brilliant detective and vital to certain investigations. This repeated protection results in Harry feeling loyal and close to Moller. Other in the police department whom he comes to trust include as friends Beate Lonn and Bjorn Holm (both in the forensics division), Katrine Bratt (a Bergen detective who helps secure specialist information), and Gunnar Hagen (Harry's former senior officer prior to Phantom). Hole's skills become renowned enough that he is considered a specialist, leading him to be sought for occasional consultation by author travels to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police (who refer to him as ""Harry Holy"").[1] In the second novel, Cockroaches, he is called to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador."
Michael Fassbender,"Outside of the department, Hole develops a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke. Her son from a previous relationship, Oleg, comes to view Harry as a father figure, sometimes calling him ""dad."" After the seventh novel The Snowman, Harry's relationship with Rakel suffers. This, along with recent trauma, compels Hole to leave Oslo and the police force. The next novel The Leopard shows Harry living in self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Kaja Solness, a new Norwegian Crime Squad officer, asks him to return to Oslo to help investigate a possible serial killing. Learning his father Olav is also ill and likely to soon die, Hole agrees to help and returns to Oslo. During the story, Olav asks his son to assist in his suicide in order to end his pain, but Harry cannot bring himself to do so. At the end of the book, Harry has a brief reunion with Rakel before then visiting the imprisoned killer of The Snowman. It is implied that Harry then aids in the criminal's own suicide. Disturbed by his recent experiences, Harry determines to return to Hong Kong for good."
Ryan Reynolds,"Wade is a man with a deeply perverted, deranged and sometimes dark sense of humor. Probably Wade's most defining characteristics is his non stop motor mouth no matter the situation and his love of pop cultures from all periods of time such as referencing Mama June or having an Adventure Time wristwatch. As a mercenary Wade is usually only in for anything for money. He is pansexual, who will flirt outrageously with pretty much anyone."
Ryan Reynolds,"Despite this, as Weasel pointed out Wade does have some moral compass as shown when he had most of the money he took from helping a teenage girl with her stalker sent back to her and as pointed let the kid who was stalking her off with a simple while very threatening warning. Another of Wade's redeemable features is his love for his girlfriend Vanessa as he was shown to do anything even considering joining the X-Men to get the help of two of their members Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to rescue her. Wade also displays some heroic traits as shown when he tackles Negasonic Teenage Warhead out of the way of gunfire and going to great lengths to prevent mutant time traveler and soldier Cable from murdering teenager Russell Collins even if it was for the good of the future."
Ryan Reynolds,"Harry's relationship with his son is shown as being strained due to his work, where Tim was raised by his maternal grandmother rather than by him or his wife. However, Harry clearly makes an effort to reach out to Tim and cares for his son very much regardless, to the point where he was willing to set up a room for him to stay in and keep it clean for years just in case his son decided he wanted to live with him."
Will Smith,"Deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional: as long as he's been paid to kill someone, he will always carry it out without mercy, except women and children. He is also sarcastic and have a personal method where he has to be paid first to get his job done and will threaten his employers furthermore when he is offended, evidenced by wanting double the original payment for his job because his ""client"" was being a ""dickhead;"" alongside his sarcasm, he has an incredibly tough attitude, and can work even under the highest of pressure."
Will Smith,"Despite his sarcastic, tough attitude, Floyd notably strikes up a friendship with Harley Quinn quite quickly, empathizes with El Diablo after learning the latter's dark secret, is greatly respected by his teammates, and has influence over them (with Rick Flag himself pointing this out), and finally he cares deeply for his beloved daughter Zoe, keeping a picture of her with him throughout his time as an assassin and inmate. He also holds a strict code about not killing women and children in his line of work, thus proving himself to have a strict moral compass. Notably, when Amanda Waller attempts to psychologically manipulate Deadshot by promising him the freedom and a permanent reunion with Zoe in exchange for assassinating Harley Quinn, he is strongly tempted for a few long moments. Ultimately, however, with quite a bit of visible effort, Deadshot realizes his unwillingness to betray his moral code of not murdering women, as well as his friendship with Harley (most likely also due to him realizing that Zoe wouldn't have ever approved of the circumstances of such a permanent reunion if she knew), and so he resists, instead pretending to miss while shooting at Harley (though Deadshot may be willing to make exceptions, to his moral code in some situations, as he plotted with Harley to kill Rick Flag and Katana and contributed to Enchantress' defeat)."
Will Smith,"Also, while not outspoken about it, Deadshot appears to be at least somewhat religious, wearing a cross while in civilian apparel and having several biblical verses written on the gauntlets and neck of his combat bodysuit."
Will Smith,"Genie is full of life and bursting with positive energy. Though he is amongst the most powerful, chaotic beings in the universe, Genie is benevolent, easygoing, and friendly; so much so that he primarily uses his abilities as a means to amuse both himself and those around him. According to the filmmakers' commentary, Genie's energy is a direct result of his imprisonment; his years of isolation have left him teaming with vigor, so whenever he is given a chance at freedom, his first instinct is to go wild with his powers by cracking jokes and entertaining whatever audience he has. He is also inviting, as when he first met Aladdin, Genie immediately introduced himself as a friend to rely on and emphasized the fact that his purpose was to magically enhance Aladdin's life by any means necessary (so long as it did not interfere with the three rules of wishing)."
Will Smith,"Though he was generally devoted to whoever held temporary ownership of the lamp, Genie has always had a will and mind of his own, outside the bounds of a stereotypical genie slave. As seen during his time as Jafar's lackey, Genie's job did not require him to agree with his masters' morals. It did, however, force him to adhere to their three commands without question, no matter how vile they may have been. Nevertheless, he was still able to provide advice to masters that were willing to listen. In the first film, he served as a mentor figure to Aladdin, often giving the latter advice and encouragement when needed, as seen when he urged Aladdin to tell Jasmine the truth about not being a prince. As mentioned, Genie did not offer himself as a mere slave, but rather as a supportive friend to his masters. His friendship with Aladdin proved that he was capable of forming genuine relationships with masters, though it was not until Aladdin that Genie was treated as anything beyond a mere slave by his superiors. This tied to Genie's dream of being freed from the lamp."
Will Smith,"Though mischievous, manic, and explosive, Genie is also compassionate, wise, and serious when he feels it's necessary. He understands human emotions to a profound degree and takes matters such as love, trust, and being true to yourself quite seriously. His more sincere moments are indicated by his tone, which changes from wily and exuberant, to low and soft when he wants to get a serious point across. Despite this, he still tries to lighten even the darkest moments with a dose of comedy, an example of this being the climax of the original film, where Genie transformed into a cheerleading squad to root for Aladdin during his battle against Jafar."
Will Smith,"Junior was created from the DNA of Henry Brogan, a Defense International Agency assassin, by Clayton Verris, the director of a black ops terrorist organization, to end the life of the outgoing assassin."
Will Smith,"He was dispatched to Colombia to find and kill Henry Brogan, almost getting on equal footing with him. Arriving at a safehouse, he is revealed to be Clay's adoptive ""son"". He is ordered to finish the job despite being curious on how he possesses similarities to Henry. Henry is also troubled by his similarities to the assassin, whom Danny suggests might be his child despite Henry's denials. He tells Baron to take him to Hungary. DNA testing reveals that Henry and Junior's DNA are identical, proving that Junior was a clone of Henry all along. Henry then meets Yuri, and learns of the cloning project and that the man he killed was one of the project's scientists. Having designed a method to produce clones devoid of pain or emotion, the scientist tried to leave the project and was killed upon being discovered."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his physical shortcomings, Hiccup does his best to succeed as a Viking. He is intelligent and is constantly creating inventions for various uses throughout the first film, including a bola launcher, a dragon's prosthetic tail and saddle, and a riding vest. However, he is much stronger than he appears."
Jay Baruchel,"Overall, Hiccup is an intelligent, kind, and likable person who is naturally big-hearted and innocent. After the first film, he and Toothless have become ""adrenaline junkies"", performing tricks like free-falling. He has also gone from being a shy boy to a confident young man, and ""the greatest Dragon Master this world has ever seen"" (as Astrid describes him to Drago Bludvist). He has a charitable and kind nature which allows him to see the good in everyone. He has especially shown to care deeply for Toothless, his parents, Stoick and Valka, Astrid, and later their children Zephyr and Nuffink."
Jay Baruchel,"He is very protective of Astrid and in the first movie, he has a crush on her. Their feelings mature as they grew up and as the franchise progressed. Among the other teenage Vikings, Hiccup first comes off as awkward, mainly because he's a poor fighter, and rather scrawny for a Viking, prompting mockery from his peers. As he becomes more adept at fighting dragons, however, they start paying more attention to him, and friendships start developing. Despite this, Hiccup remains shy and secretive, preferring to be alone with Toothless. He also tends to be sarcastic with a dry sense of humor that can sometimes put him at odds with the other Vikings in his tribe. It also seems that Hiccup likes to hide his fear with said sarcasm and dry humor. Due to his shyness, he had a habit of stuttering and stammering when talking to some of the other Vikings, especially Astrid, or when his father is angry at him."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his many virtues and his clear capabilities as a leader, Hiccup is not without his flaws. He is rather prone to letting his insecurities cloud his judgment and affect his actions; in the film, his desperation for the acceptance of his tribe, and his father in particular, cause him to regularly attempt to kill dragons along with the villagers, only to end up doing more harm than good due to his clumsiness. In Dragons: Riders of Berk, his mistaken belief that Stoick still does not accept him causes him to lead the other Vikings on a potentially dangerous treasure hunt to prove himself in ""Portrait of Hiccup as a Buff Man"". His innate friendliness and tendency to give others the benefit of the doubt cause him to be a little too trusting of strangers, leaving him vulnerable to manipulation and deceit by more dishonest characters, such as Heather and Mildew, on more than one occasion."
Jay Baruchel,"One extremely notable character trait Hiccup possesses is a deep sense of compassion. As a child, he is seen empathizing with his father over the loss of his mother, and even crying at the thought of an injured bird being killed in order to put it out of its misery. He later spares Toothless, and in doing so, changes the world of Vikings and dragons forever. He was extremely uncomfortable with the thought of having to kill a dragon in the arena in the first film. Hiccup carries this quality into the television series. He shows great sympathy to Snotlout at the end of the Thawfest Games, giving up his own glory and fame for the sake of his friend, though Snotlout showed no gratitude at all. He will almost never allow Toothless to use his full power against foes to prevent killing them. In ""What Flies Beneath"", he begs Toothless to spare a Whispering Death that had nearly killed both of them just moments earlier. The peak of Hiccup's sympathy is displayed in his releasing Mildew from an Outcast cell. Upon seeing the Outcasts take Mildew's one beloved possession, his sheep, Hiccup clearly displays pity for the old man. Unfortunately, Hiccup is occasionally naive in his sympathy, as Mildew betrayed him yet again right afterward. Still, his kind heartedness has resulted in many victories and accomplished the training of the deadliest dragons in the world."
John Dimaggio,"Harvey Bullock was the police chief of Gotham City and was also known as ""Bulldog"". Under Commissioner James Gordon, the city had to deal with the murders of women committed by Jack the Ripper. During the inauguration of the Gotham World Fair, Sister Leslie and Selina Kyle complained to Mayor Tolliver about the murders, but Bulldog blamed her shelters being responsible for attracting loose women. When Bruce Wayne showed up, he tried escorting the disrupting ladies out, only to be interrupted by Bruce who went to talk with Leslie and Gordon privately."
John Dimaggio,"He attended Leslie's funeral after she was murdered by the Ripper, and arrested Marlene Mahoney when she started threatening to Bruce that she would reveal he was near the scene of Leslie's murder. Later when Hugo Strange was murdered at the Arkham Asylum, Bullock and his fellow officers spotted Batman and Jack fighting atop a police blimp. As they shot toward them, they accidentally hit the blimp and caused it to crash land. Bulldog went after Batman,, assuming he was the killer, and gave his men orders to kill him on sight. Gordon however soon arrived to restrain him and stated he wanted him alive. Later when Marlene was found murdered, the police suspected Bruce and Harvey Dent told them that he should be at Selina's hotel."
John Dimaggio,"When Victor Fries was a child he made a hobby of freezing animals in order to preserve them so they can continue to exist in the future. Worried by this behavior, his parents sent him to a strict boarding school where Victor felt outcast and became depressed. However, when he met and befriended a young woman named Nora, the two fell in love and later married. But their happiness was short-lived: Nora was diagnosed with a fatal disease, and Fries, sickened with sorrow, attempted to save her using cryogenic technology. However, the experiment went terribly wrong and Fries' equipment malfunctioned, consuming him and his lab in an explosion of ice."
John Dimaggio,"Victor somehow survived, but now his body could only survive at sub-zero temperatures, and Nora's condition was now even more serious. In an effort to continue his wife's treatment, he constructed a suit which would now protect him in his altered state. Calling himself Mr. Zero, he began to rob several banks to get money. He was eventually thwarted by Batman and Robin, but struggled on. As Mr. Zero, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range."
John Dimaggio,"Although technically not insane, he is usually imprisoned in Arkham Asylum when apprehended by the Batman, as it is the only facility in Gotham that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell."
Keanu Reeves,"Due to his harsh background and being rigorously trained for his childhood and adulthood by The Director and his career in the Marines, John could be described as a very serious and stoic individual who rarely speaks more than is necessary (preferring actions over words and being described as someone who never wastes words) with a strong sense of obligation. As a professional assassin and hitman, John is highly confident in his abilities and reputation, being greatly respected and feared by many criminal organizations and other assassins alike. Despite this, he has a strong moral code as well as honor which is unique among his colleagues according to Zero as John never willingly drags innocent people to his job or threatens them during it. In spite of his professionalism, he is also friendly and develops strong friendships with many other dangerous people like Marcus and even managers of Continental Hotels, like Winston and Shimazu. His good side is also seen after meeting Helen, John was willing the end his career as a killer and live a normal happy life with her, which Winston referred to as impossible."
Keanu Reeves,"However, John is a man who is worth his reputation as The Boogeyman for his lethality as he never failed on his missions. Despite his calm and collected behavior, once he's angered or taken by vengeance, he will stop at nothing until he kills his target no matter who or what stands in his way. After a puppy from his wife, which was the last posthumous gift from her not to be alone, was killed and his car stolen, John set out on a journey for revenge, which he's successful but also makes other problems for himself on future eve"
Keanu Reeves,"Despite his skills, John prefers to avoid fights if he can. He is skilled at getting people to back down without resistance and will often let people go when they do and he is able to avoid allowing conflicts to escalate any further as seen when he was able to call a truce with Abram Tarasov and when he allows Zero's students to live after beating them in a fight. His friendly and professional personality allows him to maintain contacts within the assassin community who are willing to come to his aid when needed. His strong sense of honor also means he makes a point of not allowing innocent people to get caught in the crossfire of his work."
Amy Adams,"Lois is a resolute, tough, and persistent reporter, who always seeks the big scoop and story. When putting aside her job description however, Lois is shown to be kind and fair, and after her first meeting with Superman, she was so smitten with the selfless heroics, as well as the childhood pain that he had endured all his life, that she decided to drop what could have been the biggest story in modern human history for him. Superman comes to fairly quickly reciprocate her love, and after having dated her for 2 years, his love for Lois became so great, that Clark goes so far as to let her know that ""[she] is [his] world"" before confronting Doomsday in a mortal duel, making those his final words. When Superman gets resurrected with a Mother Box and suffers post-mortem amnesia, only Lois manages to save the Justice League from him, as seeing her again made Superman begin to remember his past life."
Amy Adams,"Lois also showed exceptional courage, boldly going on board the Black Zero starship with Superman when the fearsome Faora demanded it, risking her life to help foil General Zod's plan (by participating in the Phantom Drive collision counter-plan), boldly standing up to Lex Luthor with righteous anger when brought before the malevolent supergenius, risking her own life to save Superman from Batman, later risking it again to retrieve the Kryptonite spear (so that Doomsday could be stopped), and later even boldly confronting a sinister resurrected Superman (despite him having just defeated the whole Justice League in a fit of rage, as Lois correctly believed that seeing her would jump-start his memories and return his former personality)."
Amy Adams,"Lois is also quite tough, enough to be willing to kill, as she shot several Sword of Rao Kryptonians while escaping the Black Zero."
Felicity Jones,"While growing up alone from the age of fifteen, Jyn is considered reckless and undisciplined. Having little patience for debate with Alliance High Command, she prefers to take matters into her own hands."
Felicity Jones,"Even as a child, Jyn began developing a rebellious attitude but has a clear sense of right and wrong gained from her parents while growing up on Lah'mu. During her time with Saw Gerrera's insurgents, she developed a strong bond with the extremists."
Felicity Jones,"Initially, Jyn cared little about the Rebel Alliance's cause, but after watching the hologram message from her father, Galen Erso, Jyn realized how important it was that the Galactic Empire be rid from the galaxy and sacrificed herself for their cause."
Felicity Jones,"As a result of being trained by Saw Gerrera and being abandoned, develop calm yet cold demeanor, In addition, she is aggressive and distrusting, fighting off the Rebellion squad that was sent to rescue her, and keeping others at arms length until the battle at Scarif."
Felicity Jones,"Despite her aggressive and cold demeanor, Jyn is intelligent, kind, caring, selfless, has a sense of justice, honor and good morals."
Felicity Jones,"Jyn's relationship with Cassian Andor was initially complicated, as the two didn't trust one another when meeting. After learning that the immoral rebel general Davits Draven ordered him to kill Galen, she learned of his experience from the war, and the two would later become respectful allies once they disobey orders and headed to Scarif. Her relationship with K-2S0 was distasteful, with the latter having restrained her when she attacked the squad that was sent to rescue her. Despite this, K-2S0 showed himself to care for Jyn, saying he will do anything for her, and sacrificing himself for her and Cassian in his last moments."
Diego Luna,"A good Rebel agent who held dark secrets,[16] Andor was a human male standing at 1.78 meters tall[7] with brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin.[8] A man with striking good looks, Andor used his handsomeness to lure in the unsuspecting during his service as a Rebel spy."
Diego Luna,"As a Rebel, Andor was a committed, steady, practical, and by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience,[8] but that experience grew from missions that sometimes blurred the line between what was morally wrong or right. Despite his selflessness,[17] he was cold and distant to others.[16] Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary.[8] During the days of the early rebel movement, he relied on the excuse that he was following orders to justify what he had done."
Diego Luna,"Although he displayed some degree of remorse and regret after some of his actions, such as he chose to execute Tivik during the mission to the Ring of Kafrene, it was never enough to convince him to seek redemption until his adventure with Jyn Erso.[8] Nevertheless, he was more morally conflicted than fellow insurgent Saw Gerrera, who also went to great lengths to uncover intelligence on topics, particularly weapons, that threatened the Rebels.[17] In a briefing to Mothma, General Draven described Andor as ""one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,"" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion.[46] Indeed, many of the missions he carried out for the Alliance were morally questionable.[17] Mothma wondered if the command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions."
Diego Luna,"Comprising on their morals in the name of victory was dreadful for the emotional health of Rebels like Andor. In truth, Andor had been driven to the extremes he carried out by the anguish he carried inside him. Having lost everything in his life, Andor was able to hold back thinking about his morally questionable actions[17] until his time with Erso.[8] Whether it was due to killing Tivik or a change in his outlook due to the adventure he had with Erso,[17] he disobeyed orders to kill Galen Erso[8] before revealing his internal anguish by arguing with Jyn; she compared him to a stormtrooper for following orders he thought were wrong,[17] which made him burst out in anger because of all he had done in the name of rebellion.[8] In the end, Andor's selflessness[17] and regret for his past actions[8] led to him joining the ragtag Rogue One mission.[17] Meeting Erso and joining that mission helped Andor remember why he became a Rebel agent in the first place.[16] Paying the ultimate sacrifice he could in the apogee of his selfless devotion to the Rebel Alliance[17] and wanting to bring a new hope to the galaxy, Andor willingly gave his life[16] to ensure the Death Star plans were given to those who could use them to win the war."
Ryan Gosling,"A Nexus-9 replicant model, Officer K was inherently obedient and devoted in his duty as a member of law enforcement in Los Angeles. He was predisposed to be truthful and loyal to his superiors."
Ryan Gosling,"Despite his cool and collected demeanor, K could and would demonstrate that he was an experienced, hardened police officer capable of turning aggressive and contentious."
Ryan Gosling,"He thoroughly enjoyed listening to vocal jazz and standards, big band jazz and the like. K also indulged himself with bourbon upon returning from a hard day's work."
Ryan Gosling,"K's investigation pushed him to the limits, both emotionally and physically, yet ultimately he chose to act selflessly and courageously as he rescued Deckard from the Wallace Corporation."
Jason Bateman,"His primary expression is the Sly Fox which is the persona he adopted after his traumatic encounter with Pack 914 as child. However, at heart, Nick has always wanted to be a Junior Ranger Scout and the qualities they demonstrate. There are hints throughout the movie that he never fully gave up that dream."
Jason Bateman,"This is the primary image Nick presents during the film. This ""Nick Wilde"" is shifty, sly, and cunning, traits supposedly common to all foxes. He is easygoing and slick, easily conning and tricking others through his charm, quick-talking and friendly demeanor. He nearly always has a sly smile on his face with half-lidded eyes and appears unfazed throughout most of the film. He is very street smart and intelligent, and uses his vast knowledge and experience of Zootopia and its people to his advantage when carrying out his schemes."
Jason Bateman,"This personality is Nick's response to being the shifty and untrustworthy fox that society expects of him as well as providing a mask that he can hide behind so they can never see that they got to him. As a result, he deals with prejudiced statements directed at him behind an easygoing facade and often delivers a snarky comeback in response."
Jason Bateman,"The Sly Fox is particularly good at reading his fellow mammals. During their brief encounter at the ice cream shop, he picks up on Judy's naivety, idealism, and desperateness to be seen as a real officer despite her current assignment as a meter-maid. He takes all he had learned and distills it into the devastating ""whoopsie"" speech he gives later when Judy tries to arrest him."
Jason Bateman,"Because Nick has operated with this persona for over twenty years, many of the traits of this mask are now part of Nick's personality. His feeling that he needs to be shifty has led to a cynical outlook on life in Zootopia such that he feels that animals can only be what they are and never what they want to be."
Jason Bateman,"To those that take the time to get to know Nick, they will find that he is loyal and caring to his friends. His friendship with Judy evolves to the point where he risks his life to help and protect her throughout the film. He even shows a softer warmer side to himself, comforting her over her mistakes and giving her advice."
Jason Bateman,"Finally, it is noteworthy that during his Junior Ranger Scout initiation, Nick promises to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. During his time with Judy, he fulfills every aspect of that oath."
Dwayne Johnson,"Maui is boisterous, gregarious, and mischievous. His manner of carrying himself matches his massive physique, being larger-than-life and a true god among men. He is responsible for most of the necessities and luxuries currently belonging to mankind, and with his magical fish hook at hand, is amongst the most powerful figures in South Pacific lore. Widely regarded as a clever trickster, Maui is rarely matched when it comes to adversaries, being greatly feared by villains and monsters lurking throughout the sea. Maui can be extremely arrogant and pompous as a result of this reputation, although it is justifiable in every way. While his prideful ego can lead him to perform antagonistic and selfish acts, Maui is a lot less careless as a first impression may perceive."
Dwayne Johnson,"As a result of his poor upbringing, Maui has spent a majority of his life living with crippling insecurity. He goes out of his way to perform godly deeds for mankind's benefit to compensate for the love and appreciation denied to him by his parents. While he seems to enjoy the praise he earns, he secretly wishes he could be appreciated beyond his demigod status; as the human he is on the inside, rather than the deity portrayed in legends. Even so, Maui's daring adventures over the centuries shaped him into a mighty hero. Before meeting Moana, Maui credited the gods for his greatness, completely contradicting his initial arrogance. He believed he was nothing without his deity-created fish hook, and openly lamented how useless he viewed himself whenever the hook was decommissioned. Through Moana, however, he slowly began to realize that the hook is only an accessory during his adventures and that his many accomplishments over the years were a result of his own selflessness and bravery, rather than what the gods conjured to assist him in such exploits. He discovered that Moana's words of wisdom were correct when he fought relentlessly against Te K������ (without his fish hook) to save Moana and the world "
Rachel House,"Tala is spirited, eccentric, and independent. She is fiercely devoted to the idea of being true to yourself and ""listening to your heart."" As such, she never adhered to normality for the sake of fitting in, making her somewhat of an outcast, though she holds the reputation of ""village crazy lady"" with prideful awareness. She is also mischievous and playful, at one point noting that she can keep secrets from Tui if she so pleases; although he is chief, she is still his mother."
Rachel House,"Her independence nevertheless makes her a beloved and respected figure to Moana. The two share an extremely close bond, and Gramma Tala provides support and guidance throughout Moana's life. With her last remaining strength, she urges Moana to begin her journey to restore the heart of Te Fiti without delay. After her death, Tala appears to Moana in the form of a manta ray, as she told Moana she would, then appears later in her human form during ""I Am Moana (Song of the Ancestors)"" to offer her granddaughter unconditional love and wise counsel, helping Moana through her moment of deepest self-doubt."
Dwayne Johnson,"Mitch is very dedicated to his job, preferring to patrol the beach and save lives rather than sit in an office all day."
Dwayne Johnson,He shares a mutual bond with his son Hobie and tries to make things right if anything ruins their relationship.
Dwayne Johnson,He is a good friend and popular father figure to the other lifeguards who turn to him for advice and help. He has a good sense of humor with hobbies including surfing and basketball.
Dwayne Johnson,Mitch can be stern and serious when the situation demands especially if a person's life is at stake.
Dwayne Johnson,"Adam grew up as a slave in Kahndaq, being constantly mistreated and exploited by his leaders, which generated hatred towards them, but he was always full of courage and bravery to attend to situations that required it. Raising his son Hurut, Teth-Adam always tried to protect him from any evil, teaching him from an early age that the world they lived in was a dangerous one, contrasting with his son's premature desires to improve it. At some point, when Hurut observed how some gladiators mistreated a slave, he was about to help him, however Adam stopped him and told him that they couldn't do anything about it no matter how much they wanted to. However, Teth-Adam took pride in his son's morality and sense of fairness and justice, as Adam eventually smiled as Hurut handed his slice of bread to some slaves in need, telling Shiruta that he felt there was still hope in Kahndaq."
Dwayne Johnson,"Following the sudden death of his wife and son at the hands of King Ahk-Ton's forces, Adam was left traumatized and filled with emotional pain, which led him to became brutal, vengeful, cold, ruthless, and aggressive after the loss of his family to Akh-Ton's forces, Adam began misusing his powers and accidentally releasing the Seven Deadly Sins upon his family's murderers and the rest of the people of Kahndaq, killing millions. Having become invincible and taking revenge on his former leaders, Adam developed a strong ego that allowed him to consider himself unable to surrender to anyone. Teth-Adam also developed a twisted sense of justice, using a methodology where the ends (protecting Kahndaq) justify the means, so Black Adam doesn't mind coldly hurting and killing people to get what he wants. All these heinous acts caused him to be declared unworthy by the Council of Wizards, who tried to bury him and revoke his powers, however, Adam completely refused to surrender, killed the Council of Wizards as well, until he was finally buried by the wizard Shazam."
Dwayne Johnson,"Waking up in a modern world, Teth-Adam had a hard time adjusting, but continuing his brutal and vengeful nature, Adam murdered every Intergang soldier who got in his way, but taking pity on Adrianna Tomaz and Karim by instinctively saving them from being killed. a stone fell on them, because his divine wisdom predicted that they would be important in the near future. After some time and finding himself in the Tomaz residence, Teth-Adam was uncomfortable with Amon Tomaz's questions, but having compassion for the child, he simply asked him to get out of his way, even remarking that he was not a hero when he asked him to save Kahndaq. Likewise, Adam in his impression with the modern world, is surprised when he finds himself with a mirror or witnesses a television, believing that it was magic from sorcerers, Adam destroyed the television, and finding himself painful that the land in which he used to life would have changed, he went out to explore Shiruta City, curious about a statue dedicated to the champion of Kahndaq. Adam also does not have caution or care for other people's property, destroying the walls of the Tomaz residence instead of using the doors, this was even led to Kent Nelson pointing it out to him."
Dwayne Johnson,"Due to the danger Teth-Adam represented in the eyes of A.R.G.U.S., the Justice Society was sent in in an attempt to stop him, to which Adam, seeing himself threatened by them and unwilling to surrender, referred to himself as a god and that he would not kneel before anyone, easily gaining the upper hand. confrontation. Annoyed with the Justice Society and especially with Hawkman, Teth-Adam even threatened to kill them if they wanted to continue fighting, when Hawkman mentioned not disagreeing with fighting, Adam smiled. As soon as Amon Tomaz was kidnapped and Adrianna begged him to save him, Teth-Adam did not hesitate to go to the rescue and save him, killing every soldier who got in his way, which led him to have an ethical conflict with Hawkman, who was trying to convince him not to kill people since it was not something heroes should do, to which Adam remarked that he would kill if necessary, causing a brief confrontation between them. Adam was also open to having a sense of humor, adopting sarcasm when Kent Nelson mocked Adam saying he wouldn't murder people, Teth-Adam was soon sarcastic by mentioning that he loved teaming up with the Justice Society, only to then attack the Al Hadidiyah Mine, ignoring Hawkman's plans."
Dwayne Johnson,"Finding himself provoked by Ishmael Gregor who mentioned being a descendant of Ahk-Ton and mocked Hurut's death, as well as shooting Amon Tomaz, Teth-Adam unleashed all his wrath on preventing Amon's death and then took revenge by murdering Ishmael. Gregor, generating an explosion that destroyed everything around him, and if the Justice Society had not intervened, the Tomaz would have died. The intentional taunting of Adam allowed Gregor to be killed just as the Crown of Sabbac was placed, traveling to the underworld to gain demonic powers. Meanwhile, Teth-Adam was completely hurt and sorry for the damage he could have caused as well as all the massacres he committed in the past, so he finally decided to renounce his powers, traveling back to the palace of King Ahk-Ton to reflect on his actions, after Hawkman demanded his surrender and no longer feeling worthy of being the champion, Adam returned to his civilian form and voluntarily surrendered upon learning that no one could defeat him, asking Hawkman to lock him up and that they ensure he does not transform again, soon imprisoning him at the Task Force X Black Site."
Dwayne Johnson,"After Sabbac threatened to destroy Kahndaq, Kent Nelson awakened Teth-Adam in an attempt to stop him, convincing him that despite not being chosen by the Council of Wizards, he was worthy and destined to fight Sabbac. stating that he was wrong and that the world needed him, motivating Adam to escape from his prison by fighting A.R.G.U.S. guards. Remembering his son's legacy, Adam reactivated his powers and traveled back to Kahndaq, where he demonstrated that despite having to deal with overwhelming pain, Adam still had kindness in his heart and he was truly willing to give up his powers and/or sacrifice himself to protect Kahndaq and all of its inhabitants, even at the cost of his life, saving a group of civilians from having a statue fall on them and killing Sabbac with the help of Hawkman, after the battle, Adam ended up being more empathetic towards the Justice Society, even agreeing with Atom Smasher that they made a good team. Accepting his rightful role as the hero of Kahndaq, Teth-Adam finally agreed to protect the nation, but after being goaded to sit on Ahk-Ton's former throne, he deemed it wrong due to all the former king's atrocities, destroying it. Being more open to Amon's initial proposals to become a hero, Adam agreed to change his name to Black Adam, but still maintained his ego as the most powerful being on the planet, Adam was not afraid to confront Waller when she threatened him to stay in Kahndaq, causing Superman to arrive to request to talk."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Initially, Arthur is a deeply disturbed and broken man who is in a near constant state of anguish and clinical depression who still tried his best to be kind towards others. While he claims to enjoy certain things in life, it isn't clear if he is serious, as he once told his mother he was ""never happy for a single minute of his life."""
Joaquin Phoenix,"Ever since that he was born, however, Arthur Fleck was an altruistic and good man who didn't want others to suffer as he does, and always wanted to bring laughter and joy to the entire world, aiming to do so by becoming an famous comedian. However, he was often physically and mentally abused by his mother and her boyfriend due to being the estranged son of a billionaire, something Arthur later takes as hatred toward the rich and the powerful. As a result of being abused, Arthur dives deeply into depression and borderline personality disorder, he also develops pathological laughter created by the abuse."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Despite his mental health, Arthur would have never thought of giving up on his goal to be a popular comedian, and, when he goes to achieve this goal, he takes the job of a clown for a talent agency. As he was abused again by a group of teenagers, Arthur developed a hatred for society. Hence, Arthur's fragile sanity began to be broken, and he was still not giving up and found some joy in his mother and Sophie Dumond, until he wound up being humiliated by society again, this time by his beloved TV idol Murray Franklin."
Joaquin Phoenix,"When he shot the bullies, he ran to a public restroom and for the first time in his life, he experiences something unfamiliar to him: contentment. All the weight of the world, the expectations, moral obligations, all the put downs and times life had crushed him where alleviated. For the first time in his entire life, Arthur felt like he was in control and had achieved something meaningful. However, this was also one of several breaking points for Arthur and one of several lines he would cross, from that moment on he begins to develop a sociopathic persona, who lacks empathy, lacks remorse, is manipulative, violent, cold, aggressive and relentless."
Joaquin Phoenix,"As satisfaction and happiness introduced themselves to him, he dances triumphantly as he experienced all these new, wonderful, pleasant sensations. He waved his arms and swayed his head in euphoric delight. The pent-up blood cravings had manifested and were quenched. Killing felt GOOD, Arthur thought, and this satisfaction would need to be refueled again."
Joaquin Phoenix,"Arthur always loved taking care of his mother, until he learned that she wasn't his real mother and realized she had always been monstrous, false and negligent towards him, which moved Arthur to kill her, though the deed pained him. Upon meeting his estranged father, Arthur was in denial of how his father was denying his existence, yet showed joy with meeting Bruce Wayne, his estranged brother and yet-to-be his arch enemy."
Joaquin Phoenix,"After a breakdown, Arthur lost the capacity to fear anything and having scraped rock bottom for so long, he realized the only new direction to take is up as his life couldn't get any worse. He developed a totally nihilistic outlook on life and therefore decided to go with the flow rather than change anything."
Joaquin Phoenix,"As Joker, Arthur loved being completely freed from his depressed life he used to have, liking to think that his life is a comedy now rather than a tragedy, and, he later developed himself to become the leader of the Clowns after killing his TV idol in front of a horrified crowd, yet, he was already inside of his insanity, so he burst out in crazy laughter, which is commonly regarded as his first true and honest laugh in the film. Having triumphantly danced on a stair case, he finally basked in the embracing warmth of happiness and the sensation of pleasure which was new and wonderful to him. Once he accepts his new life as Joker, he expresses no remorse or regrets for any of his murders and actually seems to take pride in them and frequently made jokes about the people he killed. He also revels in the destruction and chaos he causes in Gotham, calling it ""beautiful""."
Joaquin Phoenix,"However even after his breakdown he had some moral standards as he allowed Gary to leave unscathed. He spared Sophie and her daughter as well because they never wronged him. After killing Murray, Arthur shoots Murray's corpse a second time but didn't shot Ms. Ruth or anybody else in the area despite the fact he easily could have done so since he still had bullets in his "
Joaquin Phoenix,Arthur also had a soft spot for children. He didn't fight back against the teenagers who attacked him due to their youth. He enjoyed entertaining sick children at a hospital and a young child on a bus. He spared Sophie and her daughter and stopped himself from killing Alfred when he saw a young Bruce Wayne watching in horro
Joaquin Phoenix,"However, despite his moral standards, Arthur has committed many terrible crimes to get his point across. Also, as with most versions of the Joker, his mental illness makes it hard to tell which events of the film did happen. For example, while Franklin was a bit rude towards Arthur on his show, it is possible that it was part of the program. Therefore, it is possible that Arthur's decision on who to kill or not stems from a warped morality."
Matthew McConaughey,"Walter's ultimate goal is similar to his enemy, Roland's. He intends to take over the room at the top of The Dark Tower and become ""God of All"". Flagg attempts to manipulate Mordred Deschain by getting a hold of his birthmarked spider leg to open the door of the Tower. Upon meeting with Mordred to palaver, the young spider boy senses his intentions and forces him to tear out various body parts for Mordred's nourishment and then proceeds to kill him in a rather brutal manner."
Matthew McConaughey,"He is a wealthy drug lord who heads one of the most prominent marijuana drug empires in Europe. He originally hails from the United States, but moved to the United Kingdom to study at Oxford on a full scholarship, where he began selling weed to his fellow students. As head of the empire, Mickey oversees various aspects of the business, including production, shipping, and maintenance, and must also navigate conflicts with rival drug lords."
Matthew McConaughey,"Mickey is married to Rosalind, who is a successful businesswoman in her own right and runs a car shop staffed by women. The two have been happily married for a while and Mickey dreams of retiring soon to spend more time with her. However, his plans are complicated by a potential sale of his empire to American drug lord, Matthew Berger, for 400 million pounds. When Mickey encounters unexpected challenges, he and his right-hand man Raymond must work together to uncover a larger scheme before the deal falls through."
Matthew McConaughey,"Mickey's wealth affords him many luxuries, including caviar and fine wine. He is a savvy and cutthroat businessperson, much like his wife Rosalind."
Matthew McConaughey,"He is a cool and poised character who is skilled in speaking and outwitting others. He is charming and has a great sense of humor, but he is also strong and fierce. He understands that in his line of work, appearing vulnerable is not an option, so he always maintains his composure. He sees himself as a powerful lion in the jungle and believes that to truly be a ruler, one must embody the role with confidence and authority, as any hesitation or doubt can lead to destruction."
Chris Evans,"Ransom is an eccentric but spoiled brat, whose livelihood as a playboy is predicated on his family's wealth. This makes him arrogant and unpleasant in nature, but unlike the rest of the family, he does not hide this part and has no patience for that. However, while his family is indeed unpleasant and full of hypocritical jerks, Ransom is the only one who is truly evil because he is willing to do anything to have his part of the inheritance, including murder. He is overall a selfish, heartless, psychopathic and somewhat immature person, in addition to all his family's flaws. He behaves like a spoiled teenager, even though he is in his thirties. He claims to be seeking his ""birthright,"" but does not care about the rest of his family as long as he gets his own share. He is fully aware of his disgusting nature and he takes pride in the hate his family has on him. That said, he can be charming, charismatic and polite when he wants to be, in order to have what he wants. This is seen when he succeeds in earning Marta's confidence to help him get to the bottom of the case. He is also lazy, as he refuses to work and has no intentions in doing so. But he is intelligent, as seen with his plan to frame Marta for the murder of Harlan. However, his plan has several failures. For example, he himself hired the detective Blanc, thinking he would not find the truth behind the affair and he underestimated Marta's good nature, thinking she would not try to save the life of Fran. He also displays remarkable stupidity in some areas, thinking that ""stupid"" is spelled with an ""o"" instead of a ""u"".The psychopathic part of his personality comes when he is cornered by his self-confession of Fran's murder, by trying to murder Marta with a knife, simply out of spite and refusal to accept his failure."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is considered to be ""The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths"" and in many ways he fits that title. He's flamboyant, practical, gentlemanly, somewhat eccentric, but incredibly clever, intelligent, and overall a good detective. Blanc also speaks like a member of the Southern aristocracy with an accent that has been described by Ransom Drysdale as a ""Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn Drawl"". He has a tendency to use phrases and words that not many people understand, but also often employs the use of metaphors during his cases, such as likening the case of Harlan's death to ""a donut"" and his interest in the symbolism of the Glass Onion."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is at times sneaky, relentless, and snarky, but almost always in order to further progress during an investigation. He can also be very deceiving and manipulative, as shown by his ability to make both Miles Bron's ""Disruptors"" and the relatives of Harlan Thrombey lower their guards around him in order to get extra information."
Daniel Craig,"He takes his job seriously and always wants justice to be served, striving for the truth above all else. He can appear bumbling on occasions but in no doubt has a brilliant mind, as he was able to tell right away that Marta Cabrera had something to do with Harlan's death. He nevertheless trusted her, to the point of enlisting her help in the investigation, as he approached the case more concerned with who anonymously hired him. He appears to have drawn some inspiration for his work from Harlan's books, telling Marta that his father, a detective, respected Harlan and his work."
Daniel Craig,"He is also shown to be very kind. He appears to have a tendency of helping out the ""underdogs"", as shown by how he put his faith in Marta being a good person and working with her, and also by helping Helen with trying to find out who killed her twin sister. His kindness is also very clear when he tells Marta that she's a good nurse. He reassures others and is very caring, as shown when he calms a panicking Helen before she is almost shot, and when he very gently asks a weeping Whiskey to sit down elsewhere so that he can take care of Duke's body."
Daniel Craig,"Blanc is also not without his faults; he admits to Helen that he is ""very bad at dumb things"", and calls it his Achilles' Heel. This includes games like Clue and Among Us, the former being called ""a terrible, terrible game"" by the detective, and the latter being a game he quickly loses and doesn't understand. He appears to have had a depressive episode during quarantine, as he would spend days not leaving the bathtub in his and Phillip's apartment, resulting in his partner and friends all worrying about him. He admitted to his friends that it's because his mind is ""a fueled-up racing car"" and that he had ""nowhere to drive it"", and that he tends to ""lose it between cases"". It can be assumed that the pandemic made Blanc struggle even further. He also gets extremely frustrated because of Miles, as he was expecting the murders he committed to be complex, but he realizes that they were exceedingly stupid. This, and him telling his friends over Zoom that he needs a challenge, shows that he prefers complex, difficult cases."
Taron Egerton,"Before he became a Kingsman, Eggsy was just a tough, rough and bitter individual due to his past. Despite the drugs and theft he was involved in, Eggsy has always been fiercely protective and loyal to those around him. He refused to compromise his friends by giving their names when he was arrested (despite being threatened with jail time) or revealing anything about Harry to both Dean and the interrogator, despite the threats from them both to kill him if he didn't. After he became a Kingsman agent, he soon became an extremely benevolent character."
Taron Egerton,"He's also sensitive towards animals, even crashing a car to avoid hitting a stray fox. However, it's this sensitivity that also leads him to fail the Kingsman tests, when he was required to shoot his dog."
Taron Egerton,"Eggsy also displays a very cocky and cool personality, much like every 'chav' teenager. He tended rebellion and conflict with authority figures, such as police, his parents and especially his stepfather."
Taron Egerton,The central figure in the folk-lore Robin Hood is an outlaw and excellent archer known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Robin and his group of outlaws known as the Merry Men lived in and operated out of Sherwood Forest.
Taron Egerton,"In the early ballad A Gest of Robyn Hode Robin is said to have gained a pardon from King Edward. Later Robin Hood's story was transported to a different period of English history to make the folk hero a supporter of King Richard The Lionheart who was declared an outlaw while the king was away fighting in the Third Crusade. Robin's opponents are the Sheriff of Nottingham, Guy of Gisbourne, the Bishop of Hereford, the King's brother Prince John was added to his stable of repeating villains in the late 16th century. Robin's cousin the Prioress of Kirklees was the foe that put an end to his life."
Taron Egerton,"The earliest surviving clear mention of ""the rhymes of Robin Hood"" is from the 1370s and paints him as an already established and well known piece of folklore. It is unknown if the ballads or the May Day Fair plays and games featuring Robin came first, though as time went on each clearly referenced stories told in the other medium. The earliest surviving ballad is a fragmented copy of Robin Hood and the Monk dating from about 1450."
Colin Firth,"Harry is a proper gentleman, but knows about people like Arthur that have a snobby attitude and unfairly judge others (which he agreed with Eggsy on). Harry told Eggsy about every man having his name only three times in the papers (when he's born, when he's married and when he dies) and about how posh accents don't make them anymore posh than they already are. Harry knows full well about moving with the times and claimed that Arthur saw it as a ""foreign policy"" when the latter denounced Lee as a potential agent, despite how much potential he had at being one."
Colin Firth,"Harry has always had great respect for his fellow colleagues; he was devastated when Lee and Lancelot were killed and surprised when Arthur claimed that Harry had not chosen a suitable candidate in Lee, ignoring his heroism in sacrificing himself for Harry by claiming Lee's apparent lowly statue. Harry then stating that Arthur was a snob also seems to show Harry is not one to be afraid to stand up to people such as his bos"
Colin Firth,"Harry seems to have some deep regret about not having had any romantic relationships or having any ties, stating that nothing went through his mind when Valentine supposedly killed him. This led to him realising about how important Tilde is to Eggsy and told him about saving her when they went to stop Poppy."
Colin Firth,"While he acts like a polite and charming gentleman when people first see him, Wilkins is actually a ruthless and corrupt corporate executive. This is represented in the Royal Dalton Bowl, where his counterpart is a wolf who pretends to be as docile as a lamb, signifying how Wilkins is a metaphorical ""wolf in sheep's clothing""."
Colin Firth,"During the Great Depression, William Weatherall Wilkins was first seen in his office when Michael Banks and his sister Jane arrived to discuss with him about locating their late father George's shares in the bank to pay off a loan, as Michael is falling behind on his loan payments ever since his wife Kate died a year ago. Feigning sympathy, Wilkins informs Michael that he can't find George's file and that the Banks family has until Friday to pay off the entire loan or they will have to move out from the property. As Jane and Michael leave, it turns out that Wilkins has gotten hold of George's file and burns it as he intends to repossess the Banks house by all means necessary."
Colin Firth,"As Michael and his children think of several ways to pay off the loan (with the help from their nanny Mary Poppins), the children were about to deliver Michael's briefcase to the bank, only to eavesdrop on Wilkins congratulating his lawyers for repossessing 19 houses within the week and that he will repossess the Banks house regardless of any evidence of their ownership. Realizing Wilkins' true nature, the children tried to warn Michael about Wilkins' intentions, but Michael is unable to speak out for them as Wilkins dismisses the claims."
Colin Firth,"Just as the Banks family is about to move out on Friday, Michael spotted on his old kite a drawing that happens to be part of a certificate that proves their ownership. Despite Mary and Jack's attempts to help the Banks family deliver the certificate to the bank, they are missing the pieces with the signatures right before the clock strikes twelve at midnight. A triumphant Wilkins is about to declare victory, but it wasn't until the arrival of his uncle Mr. Dawes Jr., who happily informs Michael that George made some good investments that will allow the Banks family to keep both their house and the shares. Mr. Dawes Jr. also confessed that he caught wind of Wilkins's true intentions of driving more people out of their homes, so he fires Wilkins as punishment for his corrupt practices, much to Wilkins' distraught. He is then escorted away from the bank under Mr. Dawes Jr.'s orders."
Jamie Curtis,"At the end of the film, she discovers a letter from her father and learns that Richard is having an affair."
Jamie Curtis,"In the end of the film, Linda's fortunate life is about to be downcast. Her son, Ransom is arrested for technically murdering his grandfather, Harlan. Linda discloses her father's hidden letter and reads it. Eventually, she realizes that her husband, Richard, really has cheated on her. And, she and the rest of her other relatives lose the inheritance to her father's hired nurse, Marta Cabrera."
Jamie Curtis,"While Linda comes off as a stern, short-tempered woman, she is shown to care deeply for her immediate family. Linda appears to be close to Walt, referring to him as her ""baby brother"" and becoming defensive when the investigation pries into Walt's status within the publishing company (something her husband Richard does not)."
Jamie Curtis,"Unlike the rest of the family, Linda's motivation in receiving Harlan's inheritance does not appear to be a desire for financial gain, but possessiveness over her father."
Michael Shannon,Harlan fires his son after he keep insisting his father to allow Netflix to adapt his novels into movies to make more money.
Michael Shannon,"Walt, being the youngest, is the least mature and most spoiled out of all the family members. He also seems to be the family's failson. He is the most whiney which may have rubbed off on his ""alt right troll nazi"" son, Jacob Thrombey (although his wife Donna Thrombey likely had something to do with it too)."
Michael Shannon,"While Walt appears to be politically conservative, he does not share his son's far-right views: if anything, he is unaware of what Jacob is involved with."
Robert Downey Jr,"Many people in the media thought that Tony Stark was only just an egocentric playboy. As an adult, he was renowned for being casually arrogant, apathetic, callous, and a hedonist who enjoyed the finer things in life, namely drinking, gambling, partying and flirting. His wealth, power, and natural charm allowing him to get just about any woman he wants. But despite his rather carefree and overly confident personality, inside Stark's heart lay loneliness, as Ho Yinsen aptly described him as: ""A man that has everything, but has nothing."" Even following his reformation and birth as Iron Man, this stigma surrounding Stark persisted as many were quick to point fingers at him believing his arrogance and callous attitudes were the cause of many problems even if he would have only a tenuous connection to the issue at hand."
Robert Downey Jr,"Before his kidnapping, Stark was a self-centered, arrogant person, caring for few people outside his closest friends. Even during this period of his life, he had a moral code believing the weapons he developed were being used exclusively by the United States and its allies for peaceful purposes, being appalled to discover that they were being sold on the black market. He also funded large humanitarian inventions and programs via his arms dealings, something he felt justified manufacturing weapons."
Robert Downey Jr,"During the following years, however, Stark matured, gradually becoming more of a team player and less arrogant and cynical. He even began opening up and having a real relationship with Pepper Potts. Stark's exploits as Iron Man have lead him to reevaluate his life, thus he now strives to use his inventions in a more responsible and considerate way. A textbook example of a Byronic hero, he never fully let go of his character flaws, however, using them to push him forward as a reminder to do better and often making self-deprecating jokes or comments. Despite this attitude, Stark is an exceptionally brave and selfless individual as shown when he single-handedly faced a near-omnipotent Thanos armed with nothing but a knife without hesitation, a trait that earned him the Titan's genuine respect as a hero."
Robert Downey Jr,"His experiences while imprisoned by the Ten Rings, especially his injury and seeing his weapons being used by terrorists, hardened Stark into a brave, determined, and somewhat ruthless fighter. Seeing first hand how innocent people were being harmed by his weapons and business while he remained ignorant greatly enraged him, resulting in him being uncaring in killing his foes, though he avoided doing so when he could. He was also willing to kill to protect his allies and friends, boldly saying he would kill Drax if Star-Lord killed Spider-Man. Despite this, he was not merciless, as he offered several of Aldrich Killian's men a chance to stand down, allowing the sole survivor to leave peacefully upon doing so. Even when confronted by Captain America's betrayal, he offered the man several chances to step aside."
Robert Downey Jr,"Even after starting a new life as a superhero, Stark kept his sense of humor and his penchant for showmanship, the latter being demonstrated in his armor's red and gold color schemes, and in revealing his identity in public despite being told not to. Tony has also shown a strong liking towards heavy metal and rock music groups like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and Queen. He also shows signs of being a gearhead owning and modifying several expensive cars, having a particular liking towards the Audi R8 model line."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark was also known for being exceptionally intelligent, innovative and resourceful, having built a miniaturized Arc Reactor from scratch in Afghanistan. His intellect earned him the ""Da Vinci of Our Time"" nickname, and his inventions of Stark Industries have revolutionized technology for mankind. His past as a businessman had turned him into a very pragmatic individual always taking the quickest, most efficient way out of a problem commenting to Captain America that he would simply ""cut the wire"" when given the scenario of laying on barbed wire to let others cross it. This behavior put him at odds with the majority of the Avengers during the Avengers Civil War, as they were unwilling to compromise and negotiate with the United Nations regarding the Sokovia Accords which Stark viewed as the easiest way to continue the Avengers' mission of saving people and appease the public's growing fear and unease regarding the team. As a result of this negotiator attitude, Tony was one of three Avengers to not become a fugitive by the end of the Civil War and allowed to continue saving people with the support of the United Nations. This pragmatism extended to his fighting style, as he was quick to shift over to weapons more suited to the situation or having F.R.I.D.A.Y. scan Captain America's fighting style for openings to predict and exploit. He further displayed his combative pragmatism during the Battle of Titan by first restraining the Infinity Gauntlet before unleashing an unrelenting barrage on Thanos."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark could also be a reliable friend, and occasionally showed affection toward his teammates. Hence, Stark was the only Avenger who encouraged Bruce Banner to embrace his identity of Hulk as a blessing rather than a curse, and trusted him to make good use of Hulk's powers. He has also adopted a mentor role towards Peter Parker, seeing himself in the young hero, and helping him become better by designing an advanced Spider-Man Suit and quietly teasing him about his aunt May Parker, whom Stark considers attractive, Tony was in fact the only Avenger who believed in Parker and sought out his aid. When Tony was caught up by the terrifying vision of Scarlet Witch, he was possessed and haunted with great fear of losing all his fellow Avengers while he could have done something to save them, and having to live on after they had all been murdered, which was the primary motivator of him starting the Ultron Program. During the Avengers Civil War, however, Tony became distant and hardened towards his former teammates, especially Captain America, for their unwillingness to negotiate or hear the other side's arguments, though he still cared for them. When they fought in Siberia, Tony tried to avoid hurting Rogers, who aggressively protected Bucky Barnes, destroying Tony's arc reactor to do so. Both Stark and Rogers never fully lost their trust in each other, though when they reunited, Stark mercilessly held the rogue Avengers responsible for the schism that had divided the team and left Earth unprepared for Thanos, noting that they had ignored his warnings and obstructed his desire to prepare. Five years later however, Stark abandoned this attitude, noting that resentment was ""corrosive"" and not a feeling he enjoyed."
Robert Downey Jr,"After the Battle of New York, Stark developed a strong fear, that in this new world of ""gods"" and ""aliens,"" he would be unable to protect the ones he loves, which induced him to become paranoid and full of anxiety, which, in turn, influenced Stark to build the first Iron Legion, and then the Ultron AI, so that the only threats against Earth were from Earth itself. His fear gave him something of a perfectionist personality and caused him to so intently focus on issues and problems that he unconsciously ignored other matters around him which led to a strain in his relationship with Pepper Potts and his somewhat negative reputation in the Avengers."
Robert Downey Jr,"Compared to his fellow Avengers, however, Tony was very forward-thinking, always seeing a ""big picture,"" willing to take risks, compromise his morals and dabble in shades of gray to achieve results. As seen with the Sokovia Accords, Stark was willing to endure hardships in the present to build a better future. He was also confident of his ability to negotiate, a belief supported by him negotiating a deal that would have made the Capture of Winter Soldier legal, though he knew that this talent had its limits, expressing regret that he could do nothing to free the rogue Avengers from the Raft. This more nuanced behavior often put him at odds with his fellow Avengers, especially Captain America, who were content with the status quo. Combined with his unpredictability, some people such as Scarlet Witch thought he was destructive, with her believing that Ultron's inability to distinguish between saving the world and destroying it comes from Tony."
Robert Downey Jr,"During times of great stress and frustration, Stark could become very short-tempered and intolerant of those whom he considered his intellectual inferiors for delaying a solution to the problem either mocking/berating them or ignoring them entirely. This behavior extended to both allies and foes."
Robert Downey Jr,"Stark was much closer to his mother, Maria Stark, than to his father Howard with whom he had mixed feelings for, as he thought he was ""cold and distant,"" which Nick Fury, however, claimed to be false. He still cared for him a great deal as he wished he could've said goodbye. While he was researching a new element for his Arc Reactor, Tony came across a message left by Howard, telling his son that his ���greatest creation"
Robert Downey Jr,"Though having learned more of Howard's flaws and shortcomings, Stark still retained lingering issues with his father using his parenting as an excuse for being such a strict mentor to Spider-Man. He was aware of this flaw, however, and consciously attempted to grow out of it. During the Time Heist, after talking with his alternate father Howard and realizing how difficult it was for Howard to raise him due to having an abusive father as well and having had experiences as a father, Tony finally came to reconcile with Howard and even shed his fa��ade temporarily by hugging his father and saying that he loved"
Robert Downey Jr,"Following the Avengers Civil War, Stark adapted into a new role: that of a mentor to the inexperienced superhero, Spider-Man. He connected with Parker due to the similarities between that of him and Stark, such as their love of science, technology, and heroic deeds, yet Stark was not blind to Spider-Man sharing some of his flaws and does his best to stop him from making the same mistakes Iron Man himself has made in the past. Like most mentors, Stark encourages Parker to be more forward-thinking and imaginative with his abilities while also being conscious of Peter's limitations and wanting to keep him out of fights he felt were too dangerous. Though he could come off as somewhat aloof and detached in his dealings with Spider-Man, this was all done with the intent of making Parker a better superhero than Tony ever was, and after the defeat of Vulture, Stark believed he had succeeded even going so far as to offer the young hero a spot in the Avengers. Some months later, their relationship had strengthened to the point that Stark was openly saddened by Parker's death upon Thanos' completion of the Infinity Gauntlet."
Robert Downey Jr,"Though considered a hobby, obsession or part of his itinerary, Stark considers the relationship between the Iron Man Suit and himself to be symbiotic, in that he and the suit himself are one. By the time of Aldrich Killian's terrorist attack, he had designed 42 variations of the armor as well as having stylized them with their own color designs, personalities, and names. He often referred to his suit as ""he"" when he was remotely controlling it with Potts and exclaimed when the suit's finger was pulled off, claiming it would hurt him. This is further supported during and after the Avengers Civil War whereupon the armors became incredibly streamlined and were designed to emulate a second skin. However, he does claim after the Clean Slate Protocol, that despite being without his suits he is still Iron Man."
Robert Downey Jr,"In spite of his love of the spotlight, the idea of a normal life intrigued Tony greatly as he made attempts to extradite himself from the Iron Man persona and indeed, prior to his involvement in the Infinity War, pondered the possibility of he and Pepper having children together. After the disastrous outcome of the Infinity War, Tony indeed decided to retire and marry Pepper, having a daughter called Morgan Stark. His familial life allowed Tony to find a sense of peace and contentment as a husband and father and this was the primary reason of his refusal to return to being a superhero when presented with a potential chance to undo it all but in the end his guilt over Parker's death allowed him to overcome this and he showed the same amount of selflessness as he had before, willingly sacrificing himself to kill Thanos and his whole army. Despite the agonizing pain he was subjected to as he died, he had accepted his fate, refusing aid and instead finding comfort in the presence of his friends and loved ones, dying with no regrets."

To be cured, she must eat a fruit from a land far away. Dolittle, Tommy, and a crew of animals put to sail, hoping to find the cure while trying to avoid Dolittle's long ago rival.

Chris Hemsworth,"Kevin clearly isn't the brightest, but he makes up for it in his looks. He is known for confusing relatively simple things, such as sight and sound."
Chris Hemsworth,"Being bullied all of his life, Rowan has a deep resentment for all of humanity."
Chris Hemsworth,"Before his banishment to Earth, Thor was initially conceited, arrogant, immature and stubborn. He had proven to be bloodthirsty and enjoyed the challenge of battle and combat, Laufey even stated on Johutenheim that he craved war, with the Frost Giants in particular, due to being Odin's own wars with them convincing him that they were vicious monsters. This bloodlust began as early as his childhood, with Thor then jesting that he'd hunt down the Frost Giants and slay them all if he became king. His adoptive brother Loki even commented that Thor would have killed the entire race of Frost Giants with his bare hands as an adult. However, it should be noted that Thor still had some honorable traits, as he notably supported his friend Sif in her goals to become a great warrior, while most others would not take her seriously. In his heart, he only wishes to live up to the expectations of his father to become a great king but, in truth, he did have difficulty finding the difference between a ruler and a warrior and what makes each a good man."
Chris Hemsworth,"Thor was quick to anger and could act rashly to a situation such as when Asgard was broken into his first instinct was to attack the Johtuns to dissuade them to ever do a similar stunt again. Later on, he, Sif and the Warriors Three launched an all-out attack on Jotunheim, ignoring the fact that they'd be sorely outnumbered which seems to stem from arrogance, although at the time he only went to achieve answers on how they infiltrated Asgard. When the Frost Giants had ruined his coronation, he reacted by angrily flipping over a table and finally when he was later insulted by a Frost Giant on Jotunheim, Thor reacted by promptly decapitating the former with Mj��lnir and started a fight with the other Frost Gi"
Chris Hemsworth,"Due to coming from royalty and spending all of his life in Asgard, Thor was out of place in Midgard as his boisterous personality was often part of his charm in Asgard and he was unaware of the customs and norms on Earth. For instance, when he had smashed a cup of a drink that he liked while bellowing ""another"" (thinking it appropriate in Earth), demanded a horse at a pet store and walked in the middle of a street. His vocabulary and terms of endearment were also antiquated and out of place in the modern times, he was trapped within, baffling everyone around him and leading them to believe he was delusional even though it was simply how people spoke upon Asgard. After returning to arrest Loki, Thor had seemed to gain tact but still thought that Bilgesnipe were existent on Earth. In addition, Thor was shown to initially be quite vain and egotistical. For example, while being restrained by doctors and guards at a hospital, he describes himself as ""mighty"". He was also left dumbfounded when he found himself restrained only claiming in disbelief that ""it's not possible"" due to never losing a battle beforehand with his godlike powers."
Chris Hemsworth,"When his irresponsibility and arrogance placed his home Asgard and the Nine Realms in danger, his father, Odin, banished Thor to Earth and stripped him of all his powers. That, in addition to him discovering that he was no longer worthy of Mjollnir's power, put Thor into a state of depression. This, along with Loki lying that Odin died, humbled him greatly and during his time on Midgard, fell in love with the human Jane Foster which finally taught him the humility and wisdom he was lacking. Hence, after his adoptive brother Loki sent the Destroyer to kill him, Thor defended the Warriors Three and the townspeople of New Mexico and selflessly gave up his own life for the town, thereby finally became worthy of Mjollnir again. After regaining his power, Thor would take too often holding back his great powers, unless battling an opponent of equivalent strength and durability, which Thor notably holding back in all of his duels with Loki, believing tha""[his] brother was still in there somewhere""."
Chris Hemsworth,"Thor, however, did still appear to be somewhat hot-tempered, as when he met with Iron Man for the first time, the two battled in the woods, with Thor then proceeding to charge at Captain America, when the latter intervened. However, he quickly came to see that he and the other Avengers were fighting for the same cause and befriended them, notably saving Black Widow from an enraged Hulk."
Chris Hemsworth,"At this time, Thor would become far more responsible than before, since as soon as the Bifrost was regenerated by energy from the Tesseract, Thor took it upon himself to safeguard the worlds of the Nine Realms that had fallen into chaos and conflict in the Asgardians' absence. Following losing Foster after the Bifrost destruction, Thor also became somewhat somber and Sif herself noticed this personality shift from how he used to celebrate all night long to simply staring idly at the ongoing feast of his friends. Thor has learned from his mistakes and has grown to such lengths that he surpassed Loki and even Odin. He was willing to commit treason and spare his enemies if it was honorable as he destroyed the Bifrost to spare Jotunheim and free Loki, going against the Allfather by taking the Aether to Svartalfheim to destroy Malekith as Odin's way would result in countless of Asgardians' death."
Chris Hemsworth,"While Thor was destined to become the King of Asgard, however, he eventually realized, that he couldn't actively protect the Nine Realms from the throne, and selflessly denied his birthright, even offering Mjollnir to (who he thought was) Odin. After helping the Avengers defeat Ultron, Thor temporarily left his friends, taking it upon himself to find the rest of the Infinity Stones and learn the identity of the ultimate enemy"
Chris Hemsworth,"Whatever remained of Thor's boastful personality has seemingly vanished since Odin's death and Hela destroying Mjollnir. Without an object to channel his supernatural powers, even though he retained his immense superhuman might, and with the guilt of having failed to save his father, Thor believed he was worthless which made any remains of arrogance that he had completely disappeared, as can be seen with his interactions towards people have become more awkward and overly-excitable such as when he realized that Brunnhilde was a Valkyrie on Sakaar, he tried to explain and convince her to join him rather than ordering her like he would have done with any other Asgardians. Nevertheless, while Thor's arrogance has disappeared fully, he still remains utmostly confident and assured in his abilities as a warrior, as can be witnessed when he told Grandmaster to ""point [him] in the direction of whoever's ass [he] has to kick,"" despite his champion being praised as a savage opponent. The knowledge of how Asgard realse to power further humbled Thor even more, as he was shocked and dismayed of his father's war seeking past. Although his love and respect for Odin remained as high as ever, he has come to accept that Odin's darker nature indirectly caused Ragnarok and openly admitted that Odin had flaws in his own right, even saying that Hela had a right to be angry with Odin. Though Thor has mostly unlocked the full magnitude of his powers since Asgard's destruction and Hela's defeat there still remains an awkwardness to his character, especially when compared to his previous personality. During his original coronation, he yelled uproariously towards his subjects in a victorious manner but when ascending to King of Asgard he only awkwardly waved to the Asgardians behind him."
Chris Hemsworth,"After Thanos attacked and massacred half of his kind, with only he himself as the only known survivor of the half that was slaughtered by Thanos, and witnessing Loki's death, Thor was greatly saddened and left furious by having lost his brother who he had just reconciled with and the deaths of the Asgardians and gained a strong desire to kill Thanos to avenge his people and brother, which he vowed to do so to the Titan, although Thanos was not fazed and simply taunted him that Loki is truly dead. Out of all the deaths of the Asgardians, Thor is particularly riddled with grief and anger over the deaths of his family and to a lesser degree, Heimdall, who Thor considered his best friend, and he lamented the fact that he is the sole survivor and only surviving legacy of the Asgardian Royal Family so strongly that he showed some sadness when talking to Hela, who had ruthlessly tried to kill him and even cried upon talking about Odin, Frigga and Loki. Although he retains much of his old personality, Thor has become noticeably more somber and sullen. He also seems to have gained a new perspective on why he had prevailed over the countless enemies he faced, as rather than saying it was due to his immense power and prowess as a warrior, Thor somewhat humbly said to Rocket that he believed he is only alive because fate wants it. His resentment for Thanos even made him about to attack Gamora when he learned she is Thanos' daughter, although he remains fully reasonable even with those connected to Thanos, as he went as far as to calmly talk about his own family problems with her. Having nothing more to lose, Thor valiantly and did everything he could to kill Thanos to avenge his people and family, with him going as far as to single-handedly bravely confront and wound Thanos with Stormbreaker, coming the closest to winning against Thanos. He even showed some sadism when he mocked Thanos that he had ignored Thor's promise to kill him and that caused him to be now seemingly beaten, having intentionally intended to wound Thanos first and gloat before killing him, but this proved to be a fatal mistake that Thor would deeply regret, as the blow was not sufficient to hinder Thanos, who successfully utilized the brief moment to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe and escape, causing Thor to not only be mocked once again by Thanos, who remained calm even after being wounded but also fail to avenge his people and brother as well as losing more of his friends."
Chris Hemsworth,"Following the Snap, Thor found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that his fatal mistake had resulted in the destruction of half the universe's life forms. He retained a glimmer of hope, however, and immediately voted in favor of Carol Danvers' plan to claim the Infinity Stones and bring everyone back. During the confrontation, he actually seemed to have taken the Mad Titan's taunts to heart, immediately cutting off the Infinity Gauntlet to prevent him from utilizing it. However, upon discovering that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones his wounds only deepen with shame and remorse and he kills the Mad Titan without hesitation shortly afterwards, finally avenging the death of his people. However, this brought Thor no semblance of peace at all."
Chris Hemsworth,"Even five years after Thanos' death, Thor still continued to be haunted by his failure to stop the Titan and suffered in the belief that he had not been able to embody the qualities of an ideal king that had been imbued into him throughout his entire childhood. Still, he unsuccessfully tried to keep up a facade of still being his former self and initially refused to assist in the Time Heist. However, all this changed upon seeing his mother, Frigga, again, who told him he had indeed failed and that this made him just like anyone else; finally lifting the burden of having to be an ideal king from his shoulders"
Chris Hemsworth,"Thus; Thor comes to terms with his own mistakes in the realization and acknowledgment that no individual is perfect, not even a king. During the Battle of Earth, Thor bravely faced Thanos alongside his fellow Avengers, displaying no signs of his previous anger towards the Titan. After the Battle, Thor seems to have returned to his former-self and decided to pursue a voyage of self-discovery. He also ceded the throne of New Asgard to Brunnhilde, having made peace with the fact he was not a leader."
Chris Hemsworth,"At some point, Billy found Rose Summerspring on the beach and convinced her to join his cult. After Rose's sister Emily was introduced to the cult, she eventually tried to get Rose away from it."
Chris Hemsworth,"After Emily killed an FBI agent who thought Emily was taking Rose hostage, Rose contacted Billy, telling him they were at the El Royale hotel. With his cult members Waring ""Wade"" Espiritu, Annabell Czuchlewski, Norris ""Roman"" Kindel, and Chris ""Flicker"" Grimes, Billy arrived at the hotel as Dock O'Kelly and Darlene Sweet were attempting to leave with the money. He captured them, along with Emily."
Chris Hemsworth,"Billy intended to take both the money and a tape incriminating a deceased public figure, and forced Emily and Miles to play roulette, in which he would kill the loser. He killed Emily when she lost, but before the next round, the power went out due to a storm."
Chris Hemsworth,"Unimpressed by Darlene's singing, Billy attempted to make her and Dock play roulette next, but Dock attacked him before they could. Billy was about to kill Dock when Miles, revealed to be a sniper from the Vietnam War, pointed his gun at him, and after a few moments, shot Billy in the head, and quickly killed the other cult members except Rose, who avenged Billy's death by stabbing miles and was in turn killed by Dock."
Chris Hemsworth,"In 2016, He and High T were assigned to go to the Eiffel Tower in Paris to stop an parasitic alien known as the Hive. While en route, the two agent met a couple and ordered them to leave but not before wiping their memory with a neuralyzer. Heading up to the main tower base, he and T were confronted the Hive. However, the Hive were able to infect High T with themselves and neuralyzed H so he wouldn't get in way with their ultimate plan. For 4 years, H was a known around MiB as one of the most best agent in the organization unaware of his boss's new nature. H himself never really felt like himself ever since the mission and constantly became more arrogant and lazy on his job. He never got fired since High T always covered for him."
Chris Hemsworth,"In 2019, H was on a case which involved him going undercover as a gambler. Playing a game with an alien drug dealer, H's cover was blown and he was forced to subdue all of the henchmen, however he was bitten by a poisonous snake. Knowing that the drug dealer (who was also bitten by the snake) had the antidote, he pleaded with the alien's servant to give him the serum, agreeing to sleep with the alien. Leaving the hotel, H made his way back to MiB headquarters where he walks in late in a meeting with High T. T assigns H to look out for the Jababian royal family member Vungus. H however meets young probationary Agent M, who managed to get herself to assist H on his mission. Taking a trip to London, H and and M went undercover and found Vungus at an alien dance club. H pimps out on M and decides to party along with the other guest, unaware of two mysterious aliens secretly attacking Vungus. Seeing that Vungus isn't looking to good, H has him taken home in a taxi which suddenly explodes. H and M confront the two alien twins who use pure energy against them. While M covers for Vungus, H use all sorts of weaponry to fight the twins, finally taking them out with a rocket. Vungus succumbs to his wounds and MiB later comes to investigate the scene."
Chris Hemsworth,"Back at MiB, M is able to convince T and Agent C that they need them to solve the mysterious case around Vungus's death, saying that there might be a mole in MiB. H is demoted to desk duty, however he is able to convince M to follow a lead in Marrakesh. There they run into Nasr and Bassam, who reveal that H relationship with Riza. Going to an alien workshop, they recover Pawny, the last known survivor form an attack from the Twins. Heading back outside they encounter MiB agents who were sent by High T, who convinced by Agent C believes that M and H might be the mole due to surveillance cameras showing Vungus passing a unknown crystal to M. M and H split in different directions, where H gets a super powered bike from Nasr and Bassam. H rescue M from the twins and use a red button to then escape from MiB. Stranded in the desert, H and M learn the the mysterious crystal the Vungus had was actually a weapon powered by a blue giant star. The weapon is later stolen from Bassan who plans to sell it to Riza."
Chris Hemsworth,"Late at night H and M are able to get the rocket powered bike working and plan to infiltrate Riza's Base. H provide a distraction by flirting with Riza, but Riza quickly calls the ruse, knowing that he is here for the weapon. H gets in a fight with Riza bodyguard Luca, who easily overpowers him. Taking him to Riza, she order him and M to be killed. However, M realises that Luca is in fact the alien she helped escaped 23 years ago when she was a child. Luca returns the favor by allowing H and M to go free with the crystal. Walking H reveal to M and that his real name is Henry. The trio are soon surrounded by the Twins who demand that they hand over the crystal weapons but are killed by High T and other MiB agents. T congratulates M and H and the case is closed. Back at MiB headquarters, H and M realize that something is off, when they deduce that the twins were actually against the Hive instead of being for the Hive as they previously suspected. They reveal to C that High T is actually the mole and that he is infected with the Hive. Taking a rocket powered car to the Eiffel Tower, M realises in front H that High T must have nerualyzed him so he wouldn't get in the way of their plan."
Chris Hemsworth,"At the main base tower, T tries to manipulate H by saying he was like a son to him while transforming into the Hive. While M tries to get the crystal weapon, H tries to reach to High T. H is successful in bring out T long enough for him to grab the crystal weapon and throw it to M. M is able to kill the Hive and T while ending the invasion. In the end, H mourn the loss of his father figure while M comforts him. Back on the ground, H and M meet Agent O from New York branch. H is assigned probationary head of the London branch while M is granted full agent. The next day H, M, and Pawny go off to ride H's rocket powered car."
Mark Ruffalo,"Dylan continues to act within the FBI, portraying himself as a bumbling fool in order to mislead his colleagues. He is working with Agent Natalie Austin. After a year passes, Henley Reeves chooses to leave the Horsemen because she is tired of waiting. Dylan introduces Jack, Daniel, and Merritt to the newest addition to the Horsemen: Lula May. Dylan tells them that they're finally returning to the spotlight, and for their first show in a year, they are going to expose a cyber business corporation CEO, Owen Case, as his latest software would expose everyone's personal data and would be sold to the highest bidder in the black market."
Mark Ruffalo,"However, the show does not go as planned, as the FBI arrives when they learn of the Horsemen's return, despite Dylan's attempts to mislead them. Even worse, someone hacks into the show and exposes both Jack, who was presumed dead to the eyes of the populace in order to act from behind the scenes, and Dylan himself. The group manages to escape, unknown to Dylan, and they are captured by the original creator of the software program that they were going to expose."
Mark Ruffalo,"While waiting for them at the rendezvous point, Dylan receives a call from Thaddeus Bradley, who appears to have information behind their disappearance. He reluctantly agrees to meet with Thaddeus, who tells him that if he wants to get the Horsemen back, he will need his help. Dylan agrees, and takes him outside the prison for a 24-hour leave using a fake ID."
Mark Ruffalo,"Thaddeus tells Dylan that the Horsemen were sighted in Macau, China, much to Dylan's confusion. He later learns that they were in a magic shop, which he investigates in order to find where they had gone. To Dylan's surprise, the shop is in possession of the prototype safe that his father used, including his name and logo on the inside. The shop owners give him a watch, which they say is a gift from his father. Dylan then expresses frustration and anger when he finds that Thaddeus mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind a message in a sarcophagus. Dylan later manages to track down Daniel in the market place, but is then puzzled when Daniel explains that he arranged for a trade with the Eye in exchange for the software program and will get their lives back. Daniel states that the Horsemen no longer need Dylan, who then leaves, seemingly out of anger."
Mark Ruffalo,"Walter Mabry appears, revealing that he had been behind Daniel's talk with the Eye. He threatens to kill Daniel if he doesn't give it up, but Dylan intervenes, creating an illusive change by giving Daniel the program, and tricks Walter before resisting his guard detail. He is eventually captured, and brought to Arthur Tressler, who reveals that Walter is his illegitimate son, and that his vendetta against Dylan was only made evident when he learned who he was. Dylan expresses rage with him, as he had practically left his mother helpless, but Arthur showed no care about her at all, recognizing Lionel's wife as a mere variable. Dylan is then thrown inside a safe, sentenced to the same fate as his father by being dropped into a river, left to drown. Using the lock pick inside the wristwatch he was given Dylan managed to escape his enclosure under the water. He is later rescued by the Horsemen. They reunite at the magic shop to discuss their plans."
Mark Ruffalo,"When they learn that the software is, in fact, fake. They later, with the help of the shop owners, who reveal that they are also members of the Eye, use this fake software as an advantage to force Walter out of hiding and expose him."
Mark Ruffalo,"The Horsemen immediately put their plans into action, performing separate shows that lead up to a grand finale at midnight, at Big Ben. Dylan, however, is forced to make a change of plans when Chase McKinney learns of their scheme. The group tries to rendezvous, but they are captured by Walter's security detail. They are brought to the private jet, where they hand over the program. Chase says that they should throw the Horsemen out. This is, in fact, an elaborate ploy that was planned when Jack managed to hypnotize Chase, and the shop owner did a switch with the driver. They even managed to fool Arthur and Walter into believing that they were flying out of London, when in fact it was staged. There, Dylan and the Horsemen expose Walter and the purpose behind his software program, with Dylan introduced to the crowd using his father's surname. As they make their escape, Dylan is confronted by Natalie Austin, and she asks him why he had done this. Dylan tells her that he hadn't changed; he was still doing his job. He hands her the data behind Walter's entire operation. He then escapes."
Mark Ruffalo,"Dylan later arrives at a secret library where he learns, much to his shock, that Thaddeus is a member of the Eye and was Shrike's best friend. The two played the roles of the idealist (Shrike) and the realist (Thaddeus). Thaddeus also states that he had goaded Lionel to perform his revival performance, which they had routined beforehand. But, much to his lament, they had not planned on the safe being faulty. Dylan asks why he never revealed the truth to him back when he framed Thaddeus. Thaddeus claims that he felt guilty, but he later states that he is proud of him and the Horsemen and that they have completed their training. He then leaves the room, announcing his retirement, and directs them to a secret chamber accessible through a massive spiral staircase behind a curtain. Rhodes and the Horsemen join, descend the stairs, and the film ends."
Mark Ruffalo,"Bruce Banner is shown as a mild-mannered, mysterious, shy, logical and analytical man of science. The incident at Culver University caused Banner to become somewhat mentally troubled and obsessed with finding a cure for his mutation. He is compassionate and afraid of hurting someone unintentionally, so he tries not to get close to something or someone that leaves him stressed."
Mark Ruffalo,"Ever since his first transformation Banner was terribly afraid of Hulk and the risk of him hurting those around him. He abandoned everyone and everything he cared about and became a fugitive for five years to prevent Hulk's power from falling into the wrong hands, while desperately searching for a cure and attempting to avoid transforming at all costs. On some occasions, he lost hope of getting rid of his other persona and showed suicidal tendencies, attempting to kill himself once. Banner also appears to suffer from post-traumatic stress, such as being awakened by nightmares of Hulk being shot by Emil Blonsky or falling into the bathtub when the shower reminded him of a minigun that previously attacked Hulk and Betty Ross. The only times he was willing to let himself transform was during the Battle of New York, when attempting to intimidate Wanda Maximoff, as he was angry with her for having set Hulk loose on Johannesburg, to the point where he threatened to kill her without even transforming, and when he tried to protect the Asgardians from Hela, her army of Berserkers and the Fenris. Despite this, he still dislikes having to transform into Hulk to battle, as it would require him to harm and kill others, which he expressed after the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base, as Thor commented on Hulk's kills and inadvertently made Banner feel ashamed and regretful."
Mark Ruffalo,"After having shown some success in controlling the monster, he seemed to have abandoned the search for a cure and redeemed himself, helping sick people in poor areas of the world. Thus, he appeared to be more comfortable and sarcastic in various situations with fellow Avengers. He is no longer even afraid to get angry as it no longer triggers a transformation instantly. Tony Stark encouraged Banner to see Hulk as an ally rather than a destructive curse by pointing out that Hulk technically saved his life when the Gamma exposure accident occurred. Eventually Banner became confident enough to bring out Hulk voluntarily knowing he won't attack his allies."
Mark Ruffalo,"After getting his wish of being cured of Hulk's identity, this has left Banner vulnerable and unable to help his teammates directly as he has lost the strength gained from being Hulk. However, despite this, Banner displays great courage by fighting in the Battle of Wakanda wearing the Hulkbuster Armor, even facing Thanos again without fear."
Mark Ruffalo,"In the years that followed the Snap, Banner started to see Hulk as a cure to his woes instead of a disease in need of curing. His 18-month-long transformation into his current form, which combined his intelligence with Hulk's strength, helped him feel peace and acceptance in his life, a balance that the separation of Hulk and Banner would never have allowed as long as it remained."
Mark Ruffalo,"Ironically, Banner was one of the few individuals who improved themselves in the post-Snap world. In contrast to figures such as Tony Stark or Thor, who had quit heroism, Banner was active within the community. Consequently, he became a celebrity and a figure of safety and stability in the fragile world. Attitudes about Hulk sharply contrasted to those a decade ago. A once feared figure was now a beloved hero."
Mark Ruffalo,"In his new form, Banner kept his pacifist ways, having expressed disgust at War Machine's suggestion that the Avengers strangle an infant Thanos and written off his past penchant for property damage as ""gratuitous"" before halfheartedly smashing up a New York taxi, later he obtained the Time Stone by calmly negotiating with the Ancient One instead of attacking her. Despite his guilt for losing to Thanos twice, he felt no need to seek vengeance when Thanos attacked the Avengers Facility. This, combined with his embarrassment of his past Hulk-self, illustrates how he had moved beyond feeling a need to 'smash' things and prove his strength."
Mark Ruffalo,"Banner became significantly more casual and confident in public areas after Hulk became a celebrity, openly giving autographs to his fans and joking about ""Hulking out"" while doing so. Despite this, Banner can still take a more aggressive form when the situation calls for it and behave more like his former Hulk self, as seen during the Battle of Earth. Additionally, during times of conflict, Banner had developed a polite sternness and authority. This was seen during his encounter with Thor on New Asgard, in which he politely asked Thor to stop holding him before forcing him to let go. Furthermore, during his encounter with the Ancient One, Banner asked for the Time Stone before calmly attempting to take it from her."
Mark Ruffalo,"The Nano Gauntlet and the Blip represented a chance for Banner's life to have a meaningful resolution. Previously, Banner would not have been strong enough to solely wield the gauntlet. Conversely, Hulk would not have had the mental capability to resurrect half of all life. Banner noted the irony of Stones emitting gamma radiation; as it was his expertise and the source of Hulk's power."
Mark Ruffalo,"Hulk is more primitive and illogical, with his senses amplified to such an extent that it is difficult for his brain to process it all. In his earliest transformations, Hulk appeared as a simple-minded savage with little to no ability to distinguish friend from foe. Because of this, he was responsible for the deaths of two scientists, an army officer, a police officer from Idaho, and two Canadian hunters when he was a fugitive. However, while extremely aggressive and destructive, Hulk primarily attacked when provoked as a form of self-defense and wanted to be alone, often fleeing and ending up in areas uninhabited by humans like caves or forests to calm himself."
Mark Ruffalo,"Hulk keeps fragments of Banner's personality and gradually attained a better reasoning capacity over time, becoming able to show affection, demonstrating a capacity to work collaboratively with others once they've established a rapport with him, and evidencing he's capable of directing his savagery at foes instead of allies. Betty suggested that this is because Banner's mind is still within Hulk and can influence his behavior to a degree. Even in his early stages, the mostly taciturn Hulk has demonstrated being capable of crude, rudimentary speech to the point of usually naming himself in the third person, notably telling soldiers to leave him alone in Brazil and calling Loki a “puny god” after repeatedly hammering him into the floor of Stark Tower. Banner's emotional bonds to those closest to him persisted even during his earliest transformation, as Hulk has always been able to recognize and been protective of Betty Ross. In the past, people whom Banner has had romantic feelings for in particular have acas Hulk's handler, as they are able to soothe him into a calmer state. Hulk would check his aggression if Betty desired it and would be given a lullaby to lull him into his normal state by Black Widow."
Mark Ruffalo,"While initially compelled into conflict due to his aggressive survival instincts and Banner's attempts to influence him, Hulk has also displayed being pleased when given the chance to channel his aggression, notably grinning after being told by Captain America to “smash” invading Chitauri. Similarly, Hulk was shown smiling after being unleashed from Banner by Natasha, who intentionally knocked him off a platform. This was seemingly due to both his and Bruce's bond with Natasha, as well as being freed from Banner's cont"
Mark Ruffalo,"Hulk would also sometimes show reluctance to revert into Banner and relinquish his control over their body, becoming more self-aware. In fact, Hulk would consistently become belligerent when being referred to as Banner, something Stark remembered being warned about after him making this very mistake sent a mind-controlled Hulk into a violent rage. For example, he once attacked Black Widow on the Helicarrier, when they were blasted out of the lab and he transformed and attacked her, and when Wanda Maximoff used her mental manipulation powers on him in South Africa to force him to transform. As her influence faded, Hulk showed remorse at the destruction he caused the people caught in the crossfire of his rampage before being briefly provoked at the site of armed police approaching and knocked unconscious by Iron Man. After the war against Ultron, Hulk himself decided to abandon his Avengers friends and exile himself much like he did when he defeated Abomination."
Mark Ruffalo,"During his time in Sakaar, Hulk's control over Banner's body increased significantly, to the point that he was able to stay as Hulk for two whole years and prevent himself from reverting to Banner. His increased self-awareness gave him increasingly visible layers of personality, similar to a five-year-old's,[49] instead of just being a very destructive rage monster. By the time Thor found Hulk while himself trapped in Sakaar, Hulk became intelligent enough to actively converse with others, albeit still with an immature speech pattern. Thusly, he was able to verbally acknowledge his human half but repeatedly refuted Banner's existence, claiming ""No Banner, only Hulk!"" to resentment and bitterness for Banner. He would later call Thor “Banner's friend”, demonstrating a reluctance to trust or help him as a result. While he gained more self-awareness and personality, Hulk was still susceptible to emotion and could easily become more feral due to stress and frustration, such as when he fought Thor in the Contest of Champions. Despite this, he could still demonstrate a calm and stable demeanor, which allows him to not solely act aggressive and hostile, such as when he talks calmly with Thor after the two of them argue and befriend Valkyrie during his stay on the planet. However, Hulk was also wary of others, due to his history of violence on Earth, which caused him to believe that humanity hated him and made him refuse to return. As Banner's personality resurfaced do to Hulk's positive encounters with Thor and seeing Romanoff's last message to him after their battle with Ultron, Hulk became frantic and desperately tried to not lose control to him, resorting to almost pleadio Banner to stop."
Mark Ruffalo,"Hulk's time on Sakaar allowed him to fully develop his own identity. Having risen to the top of the ranks and becoming the Grandmaster's Champion, Hulk enjoyed a celebrity lifestyle. This was as close to a ""normal life"" that he was able to enjoy. During such time, he was able to develop his emotions beyond just anger. His interactions with Valkyrie and Thor demonstrated his playful nature. In addition, upon hearing Thor's spiteful claim that Earth indeed hated him, Hulk appeared genuinely upset. This fortifies the notion that Hulk doesn't want to be alone as he claims. This was highlighted when he begged Thor to stay on Sakaar as his friend. Unfortunately, Hulk's low emotional intelligence and raw strength provide a combination that creates a being who cannot easily co-exist with others. Tragically, Hulk may be the loneliest Avenger yet the one who needs friends the most."
Mark Ruffalo,"Because Hulk has never lost a fight before; his experience and growing intelligence in Sakaar reinforced the idea and image so much that he believed himself to be invincible, no longer a primitive rage monster like when he first came into existence, and now capable of grasping a wide spectrum of emotions, the defeat at Thanos' hands traumatized Hulk tremendously; he has since grown fed up of being used as a weapon by Banner and the Avengers that he outright leaves Banner alone to fend for himself for the first time since his creation, to the extent of staunchly refusing to transform and come out to fight even when told to."
Scarlett Johansson,"The entirety of Romanoff's character was hard to distinguish based on how she tricked and lied to people for a living. She was capable of convincingly portraying friendly and flirtatious, timid, vulnerable, and scared. For the most part, she was a level-headed, strong-willed, and independent woman. Romanoff normally maintained a controlled, almost emotionless persona to keep whatever she was thinking a secret unless she was around people she absolutely trusts. Although she was more than willing to rush into deadly battle and other unnerving missions for S.H.I.E.L.D., she was not completely fearless, as she was visibly frightened of Hulk. However, she was no longer afraid of him due to falling in love with Bruce Banner."
Scarlett Johansson,"Though a very serious agent, Romanoff was by no means stuffy and has a sarcastic sense of humor, which mostly surfaces when she was with Captain America or Hawkeye, both of whom she was comfortable around. Romanoff was very smart and loyal which was displayed when she made good on the debts she owed Barton and Rogers (saving the former from Loki's mind control and trying to protect the latter during a highway assault). While tough and at times ruthless, she was still a good person and can be quite heroic in her own right. These qualities are usually brought out by her other Avengers, mainly her missions with Steve Rogers. And no matter how injured she was in battle, Romanoff will go out her way to make sure bystanders are out of harm's way (keeping several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents away when Banner was transforming into Hulk, helping Hawkeye evacuate civilians when the Chitauri attacked Manhattan, and risking her life to make sure innocent people weren't shot by the Winter Soldier when he was chasing her). Her close loyalty to both Rogers and Barton was shown in the Avengers Civil War, as she was willing to aid their faction despite being forced to go on the run from the United Nations afterward. As a result of her childhood, she considered the Avengers her family, being desperate to keep them together when the Sokovia Accords were due to be signed and was affected when Tony Stark denounced her as a friend and made it clear he would not help her in the future. She was further shocked and saddened when Barton following the loss of his family became more ruthless and violent when she encountered him in Tokyo."
Scarlett Johansson,"Romanoff was also very close with Clint Barton's family, especially with his and Laura Barton's only daughter, Lila, being the only member of Avengers who knew of their existence. Romanoff was genuinely affectionate with the child, hugging her the moment they reunited and sweetly commended the little girl on the drawing she made. They originally named their youngest child after Romanoff before them discovering that it was, in fact, a boy, thus naming him Nathaniel instead, with Romanoff humorously referring to the unborn child as a ""traitor."" This was further proven in Vormir where she refused to let Clint sacrifice himself, knowing how much he meant to his family and vice-versa, and sacrificed herself instead because she believed she had less to lose."
Scarlett Johansson,"Romanoff was sterilized as a rite-of-passage for her graduation from the training she underwent in the Red Room under the supervision of Madame B. This event deeply affected her, as she regretfully told Banner of the so-called advantages of the procedure."
Scarlett Johansson,"Despite her lifestyle of espionage and operating within the shadows, Romanoff's adaptability influenced her opinions on the Sokovia Accords. Realizing the difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers with many of their activities seen in the light of day amongst the public, Romanoff wanted to appease public opinions by signing and also that she didn't want conflict with her close friends and teammates like Barton and Rogers. This care for Captain America eventually caused Romanoff to betray Stark's team and assist their escape so they could clear Barnes' name, eventually becoming a fugitive because of this."
Scarlett Johansson,"Despite her harsh and traumatic upbringing, Romanoff retained a kind, caring and compassionate side of her, with Melina Vostokoff expressing surprise at how she was able to keep her heart after all she had been through. For years, she harbored deep resentment and guilt towards herself due to the damage she had caused during her time in the Red Room and S.H.I.E.L.D, and spend most of her life attempting to make up for her actions. This was most evident when she freed Taskmaster from Dreykov's control, and tearfully apologized to her adoptive sister Yelena Belova for not coming back for her."
Scarlett Johansson,"Kaa is a sly, devious Indian Rock Python. He speaks with a soft, often entrancing tone to either lure his victims into a weary, dreamlike state or manipulate them into bestowing their trust, only to devour them unexpectedly. He furthers this by the use of his iconic ability to hypnotize his prey with his eyes, rendering them enchanted and under his command. A powerful and dangerous ability, Kaa is a feared inhabitant of the jungle. This is evidenced when the usually composed and fearless Bagheera was visibly terrified and pleaded with him when the panther stopped him from eating Mowgli. Such fear, however, does not resonate with the unofficial ruler of the jungle, Shere Khan the tiger. Kaa holds a disliking for Khan, seeing him as a hypocrite and believing the act of killing for pleasure—as opposed to survival—to be dishonorable. The two beasts are often at odds, though Shere Khan views Kaa as""eyes and ears"" of the jungle, relying on him to assist his search for Mowgli at one point in the film."
Scarlett Johansson,"While not inherently malevolent, Kaa is still a fairly villainous character. His first attempt to devour Mowgli was a casual and opportunistic means to eat and survive. However his later goal to eat the man-cub was mainly driven out of spite, swearing revenge on th boy after his first attempt to eat Mowgli ended in humiliating defeat. Furthermore, he is perfectly willing to kill those who get in the way of his meals, as seen when he sadistically hypnotized, and almost harmed Bagheera."
Scarlett Johansson,"His sadism is further emphasized by how he gloats over Mowgli's helpless situation before eating him. He displayed even more sadism towards Shanti as he did not only gloat over her helplessness, but also outright revealed to her that he intended to eat her knowing she was unable to do anything about it. He enjoys teasing and playing with his food, hypnotized or not. He playfully tugged at Mowgli's wrists and ankles to stop him from escaping, and later savoured the time before the kill when he hypnotized the man-cub and made him sleepwalk over his body."
Scarlett Johansson,"Nevertheless, Kaa seems to insist on giving his victims a merciful end as he hypnotizes them into a state of bliss or sleep before eating them. Although powerful enough to choke the life out of his victims, he prefers to swallow them alive and whole unable to feel pain or fear. Kaa has even admitted to himself that he is sympathetic towards Mowgli to a certain extent, before remembering his own intentions to make a meal out of the boy."
Scarlett Johansson,"Kaa seems to have a taste for humans, calling them ""delicious"" and ""succulent"". Even when very young, he seemed to relish the idea of eating man. Whether he has ever successfully caught and eaten a human is unknown."
Scarlett Johansson,"Though dangerous, manipulative and cunning, Kaa is not without his faults. Although he only hypnotized Mowgli when he was sure Bagheera was too sleepy to notice him, it was his own cockiness that woke the panther and made him lose his supper. He can be clumsy and easily sidetracked from his primary objective: to hypnotize and eat Mowgli. This results in his interactions with the man-cub to often end in humiliation to some degree."
Scarlett Johansson,"Rosie is sweet, selfless, caring, heroic, and clearly not okay with the atrocities the Nazis are committing. She can be a bit sassy and overprotective, but she knows that one day Hitler will be defeated, and she's willing to die for her cause."
Don Cheadle,"James Rhodes is a highly distinguished officer of the United States Air Force. Though he is supportive of his best friend Tony Stark and generally enjoys being involved in his revelries, he is sometimes annoyed by Stark's flippant and reckless behavior. Rhodes was upset at Stark's decision to stop weapon manufacturing, although he chose to aid Stark to defeat Obadiah Stane by preventing the Air Force's involvement. However, shortly after Stark officially became Iron Man, his disrespect of government officials and refusal to relinquish his armors to them placed Rhodes in a difficult position since he has to balance his responsibilities to his superiors and respect his friendship with Stark, forcing Rhodes to side with the government and steal the Iron Man Armor: Mark II. As liaison to both Stark Industries and the Avengers, Rhodes strives to maintain a copacetic relationship between United States government and his teammates."
Don Cheadle,"As a military man, he is a firm believer in people being held responsible for their actions and a proper chain of command. This made signing the Sokovia Accords an easy decision for him as it would make the Avengers accountable for their actions, reduce the collateral damage, and have an improved reputation. As a result of this, he fought those who believed their actions to be ""right"" and would flout the law to accomplish them, shown when he confronted Captain America's faction during the Clash of the Avengers. However, as time progressed, Rhodes became increasingly frustrated with the restrictions imposed on the Avengers, as well as Thaddeus Ross and the United Nations labeling his friends as criminals so much so that he chose to receive a court-martial when Ross demanded Rogers and his team arrested despite there being an imminent threat approaching Earth."
Don Cheadle,"For the most part, Rhodes maintains a sense of professionalism and strives to do whatever he feels is the right thing for the American people. This often causes tension between him and Stark, though the two nonetheless maintain strong mutual respect and friendship. Rhodes also takes great personal pride in his work; when attending the party following the retrieval of the Scepter, he enjoys getting laughs from recounting stories of his work as War Machine, and his ego is somewhat deflated when he doesn't get the reaction he's looking for from Stark and Thor. Despite becoming partially paralyzed as a result of siding with Stark against Captain America over the Sokovia Accords, he freely admits having no regrets, as he believes it was the right thing to do. This would in time change, as he later openly admitted his disappointment and frustration that the Accords had ultimately done more harm than good by fragmenting the Avengers, forcing many of them to live in hiding in a time they were needed. After the friendly fire incident that left him paralyzed, he also held no animosity against Captain America and his team."
Don Cheadle,"Despite his sense of professionalism, however, he enjoys wearing the War Machine suit and is largely disappointed when it underperforms, such as when the Ex-Wife Missile installed in his suit did not work when fighting Whiplash. Though he states that being rebranded as Iron Patriot comes across well as it was less aggressive, he secretly prefers being referred to as War Machine and quickly goes back to this persona following the end of Aldrich Killian's War. However, he is often left in awe when faced with more extreme super-powered individuals; the sight of Aldrich Killian breathing fire alone was enough to make him hesitate despite defating his men, and when preventing several Ultron Sentries from fleeing was left wondering what he had just witnessed when Vision did his job for him."
Tom Holland,"Outside of his Spider-Man persona, Parker lived the life of a normal high school student, being a very intelligent, science enthusiast, and capable of inventing and building his own Web-Shooters, as well as homemade computers. Parker is also an avid Star Wars and science-fiction fan, making frequent pop-culture references to it in battle. In addition, Parker is highly impressionable towards figures of authority, which is likely due to his young age and inexperience. Parker even takes harsh words and criticism to the heart, as this caused him to question his heroics and intentions in helping those in need, loves and cares about. Despite this, Parker is a friendly and kind but shy and awkward individual; he is happy to talk but often stumbles on his own words in a conversation."
Tom Holland,"Through his love of science, Parker was amazed to find out that the Multiverse was real, as seen during his first conversation with Mysterio, but thought it was a lie once he discovered his ruses. However, after his encounter with Doctor Octopus and Green Goblin, and Doctor Strange telling him that the botched up spell he messed up brought individuals from two different universes, Parker was not only shocked that the multiverse truly does exists but also realized that Mysterio was unknowingly telling him the truth. Parker's intelligence is boundless as he is smart in other subjects, such as math. Also, Parker's intelligence has impressed many, as Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, Quentin Beck, Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius were amazed by his knowledge and skills."
Tom Holland,"As Spider-Man, Parker is courageous and capable, being able to come up with clever strategies due to his scientific expertise. His bravery even led him to secretly board a Q-Ship in an attempt to help Iron Man against the universal threat of Thanos, despite knowing that Parker could lose his life in the conflict to come. He frequently annoys his enemies with fast-talking humor and quipping, prompting members of both Captain America's faction and Iron Man's to ask how old he was during the Clash of the Avengers. Parker was also overly-excited about being Spider-Man and constantly called Happy Hogan to ask him about ""a new mission with the Avengers,"" unknowingly irritating him. He was very displeased about having to stick with minor jobs like stopping a bike theft or helping an elderly woman. Despite this, Parker would still put those in need first before himself as his Aunt May taught him the true meaning of helping people and that everyone deserves a second chance whether they are good or bad."
Tom Holland,"In the beginning of his superhero career, Parker made sure that he kept his identity as Spider-Man a secret since if such knowledge were to be made public, his aunt would be worried sick and he would have major trouble with the law on the grounds of vigilantism. Parker also showed a strong desire to impress the other superheroes and prove his worth, especially towards Iron Man. In addition, Parker would get frustrated when other superheroes do not take him seriously, due to his young age, although it maybe due to wanting to prove himself and them that he can handle being Spider-Man despite being a teenager. Parker was particularly angered when he found out that Stark was limiting many of his suit's functions with the Training Wheels Protocol and demanded Ned Leeds to hack into the suit to disable it, but it ended up putting him at a disadvantage, due to not being familiar with the suit's full capabilities. In addition, during the Clash of the Avengers, Parker was the least experienced fighter."
Tom Holland,"Parker also values life and has a code to not kill people, as seen when he ordered Karen to not make him hurt anyone when he activated his 'advanced combat mode'. In addition, Parker tried to stop Vulture from overloading his wings and when it happened, he risked his life to save him from the explosion and resulting fire, even though he tried to kill him and knows his secret identity. Also, Parker's code to not kill people has led to a disagreement or fight with individuals, as shown when Doctor Strange insisted on sending a group of villains from different realities back to their universes and meet their fates instead of trying to help them, due to them having mental and psychical issues. However, despite his value on life, he was shown to use a strategy that would threaten the lives of his enemies, as his plan to have Iron Man breach the hull of the Q-Ship they were in resulted in the death of Ebony Maw, who was sucked into the vacuum of space."
Tom Holland,"Sometimes, Parker can be reckless and doesn't think before he acts, as those traits caused him to make various mistakes. Also, in rare instances, Parker's recklessness has threatened the lives of innocents, as some of his battles nearly hurt or killed anyone that were in the area, and almost unintentionally broke the multiverse when he asked Doctor Strange for help in restoring his secret identity, but ended up changing his spell when he still wanted those who are closes to him to still know about his double life. However, despite all the mistakes he has made, Parker still has good intentions and would always try to do the right thing. Also, Parker would use his mistakes as a learning experiences as he becomes more aware of his flaws and more determined to rise above them."
Tom Holland,"Parker at times has shown to have a guilt complex, as seen when he blamed himself for Iron Man and his Aunt May's deaths. His guilt for his aunt's death was further accentuated by J. Jonah Jameson's gaslighting reporting, leading him to nearly abandon his mission of curing the multiverses visitors of their antagonistic qualities and give up to send them back to their fates until his alternate selves convinced him to finish what he started. Also, Parker's guilt was one of the main reason he decided to distance himself from his friends, allies and fellow superheroes, after they have forgotten his existences through Strange's second spell, as he felt deep remorse for putting them endanger and negatively affect their lives."
Tom Holland,"Throughout his attempt to capture the Vulture, Parker managed to hone his skill with his suit through the help of Karen. Also, Parker was able to better understand the dangers of being a superhero, becoming more serious and determined to capture Vulture on his own while wanting to prove to both himself and Stark that the Spider-Man Suit is not what makes him strong. In addition, after he successfully stop Vulture and his operation, Parker made the mature choice in turning down Stark's offer to become an official Avenger as he realized that he wasn't ready, a decision which Iron Man himself applauded. Also, overtime, Parker has shown to become a mature and responsible as both a person and superhero, as it was fully shown when he decided to stop the Multiverses from breaking apart by having Strange make everyone magically forget his existence, knowing full well he would never get his old life back and would now be nothing more than a stranger to his loved ones, demonstrating his maturity from an overly eager, careless teenager into a selfless, heroic young man ready to lose nearly everything in order to protect the world and rectify his mistakes."
Tom Holland,"When he was anointed as an official Avenger, Parker was shown to be both honored and exhilarated. However, after the events of Infinity War and Battle of Earth, Parker shied away from the spotlight as he tried to avoid Avenger-level threats and decided to keep being a street crime-fighting hero, which was in contrast to when he initially wanted to do more and become an Avenger. Despite this, Parker would still fight the bigger threat in order to protect those he loves, the innocents and the world. Also, Parker ultimately found his resolve to continue protecting the innocent as the web-slinger, even after being left all alone and a ghost to the world except for his Spider-Man persona, due to losing Stark and his aunt, and his friends, allies, and the entire universe having no memory of him after Strange's second spell. In addition, Parker took being unpersoned as a second chance to be a better Spider-Man."
Tom Holland,"Parker deeply cares about his friends, Tony Stark, his idol, mentor and father figure, and Aunt May, his only family. His friends, Stark, and aunt being endanger is the one thing that would push Parker over the edge, as he would abandon his own morals and lay down his life in order to protect them. Also, if those he loves got hurt, Parker would reveal a darker and more sadistic side, as seen during the final conformation against Green Goblin, even going to the point of trying to murder him, despite Osborn being trap inside him. However, Parker came back to his senses as his oldest counterpart helped him realized that this isn't what his aunt would have wanted. Also, Parker decided to cure Osborn as he understood that his actions wasn't his fault and is his friend who needed his help. Despite this, Parker, out of anger and hatred for Green Goblin, didn't give a cured Osborn an answer as to what he has done. In addition, Parker's close bond with his friends, Stark and aunt was his inspiration to carry on as Spider-Man as he kept mementos and the wisdoms left by them, even though he lost some of them or they have forgotten about him."
Tom Holland,"Through his growing relationship with Stark, Parker realized that he would have to let his closest friends and aunt in on his double life as Spider-Man, as he cares and trusts them to keep it a secret. Also, once he comes to trust one of his fellow superheroes, Parker would reveal his identity to them, such as when he met Doctor Strange, who he formed a genuine friendship with, and Captain Marvel. Unfortunately, ever since the events with Mysterio and the latter revealed his identity as Spider-Man to the world, Parker lost faith in trusting people and would't open up to anyone that isn't close to him. Parker's faith in trusting people became worse, after Green Goblin killed his aunt. However, through his counterparts and Octavius' help, Parker was convinced to not give up on trusting people and to have faith in them. Although, despite his regain faith and trust in people, Parker made the decision to isolate himself from everyone, including his friends, allies and fellow superheroes, as he has come to believe that he was dangerous to be around and feels that those around him were better off without him."
Tom Holland,"Upon meeting his alternate selves, Parker dismissed them at first, but Michelle Jones convinced him to hear them out. After finding out that their own actions and mistakes caused the deaths of their loved ones, Parker empathize with his counterparts. Also, once he got to know his counterparts, Parker formed a close bond with them and comes to see them as older brothers. Parker was even impressed that his older counterpart created cures to help the villains and his oldest counterpart also fought an alien villain. Parker was also amazed that his oldest counterpart can produce organic webbing as he and their alternate self curiously asked him how it worked later on. In addition, Parker was surprised that there weren't other superheroes like the Avengers in his counterparts' universes. Parker even values his alternate selves' safety, as seen when he checked on his oldest counterpart, after he had been injured by Green Goblin."
Tom Holland,"At the first glance, Walter lacks in social graces, as he is very awkward around people he meet. However, he makes up for it in intellect and creativity. He provides himself with amazing gadgets he uses on his many globetrotting missions. Walter is gifted in science, has a bizarre obsession with pigeons (and to a lesser extent, Korean pop culture), expresses his knowledge in pigeons via random facts about them, has strange ideas when it comes to his inventions, and is often considered ""weird"" by everyone because of this. Despite this quirk, he has a moral compass, as Walter sees the world as populated not by ""good people"" and ""bad people"", but just people he can help. Also, he deeply believes that violence is never the answer and all of his gadgets are made to be as safe as possible yet still effective, much to the doubt of everyone at the agency, including Lance."
Tom Holland,"Later it is revealed that Walter's moral compass and refusal to harm others comes from his grief after his mother died in a gunfight where she saved many lives. Walter's belief in non-violent means of solving problem goes as far as when he and Killian were about to fall to their deaths he gave Killian a safety bubble to survive the fall, Walter was ready to die before being rescued by Lance before he hit the ground. Walter also proved to be fiercely loyal to Lance, when Lance forced Walter to leave because he didn't want Walter to be yet another casualty in the line of fire, Walter returned to save Lance soon after to rescue Lance."
Tom Holland,"Ian has a kind, caring personality and loves both his mother and brother. However, as a result of not knowing his father at a young age, Ian developed an awkward personality where he was afraid to try almost everything. This led Ian to be unconfident in his capabilities to do anything, despite him striving to be like his father whom he admired so much."
Tom Holland,"Despite loving his brother Barley who was his polar opposite, Ian was secretly annoyed by and skeptical of his brother's antics and had a hard time going along with Barley and his ideas. However, over the course of their journey, Ian's bond with Barley grew stronger and he realized that although he never knew his father, Barley was the one who helped and guided Ian throughout his life, making him the father of his life."
Tom Holland,"Ultimately, his yearning for his father, while understandable, led to the development of his greatest flaw, which is his lack of appreciation for the worthwhile things he already had. His other shortcomings stem from this core trait, from the somewhat distant, if loving, relationship with his brother and mother, to his low self-esteem and social awkwardness. In the end, it was by letting go of his father and the expectation that he had to be like him that he grew into his own."
Tom Holland,"After the brothers' adventure, Ian became more confident and social where he made new friends, accepted his mother's new boyfriend (who he was uncomfortable about in the beginning) and spent more time with his older brother. He stands up straighter and although he is still awkward, he is now more willing to try taking risks."
Dwayne Johnson,"Practical, resourceful, smart and extremely courageous, Hobbs has a serious and formidable personality. Hobbs is a strict and single-minded person, he was dedicated to his profession as an agent in the Diplomatic Security Service. He tends to chafe when operating with other authorities, government or localized, and prefers to work within his own perimeters. However, Hobbs displays a strong sense of loyalty to those who work alongside him, and is willing to defend them without question unless given reason. Hobbs works preemptively when concerning new or temporary partners, researching their background to better understand their character."
Dwayne Johnson,"Hobbs does not question the perimeters of his orders when they're given to him. Whereas Elena Neves would question the circumstances of her targets as a police officer, Hobbs pursues Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto without question to the larger picture or their motives because their names ""hit his desk"". Whether or not the information given to him is the complete truth doesn't matter. However, when betrayed or corrected on a situation, Hobbs is willing to work with then convicted felons like Toretto or O'Conner in exchange for revenge for Reyes killing his men. Despite his position as a federal agent, Hobbs follows an ""ends justifies the means"" ideology and is not reluctant or shy about breaking the law or using brutal tactics to ascertain information. Hobbs is not entirely against granting pardons to known criminals when the situation calls for assistance or information he may not be able to access immediately with bargaining."
Dwayne Johnson,"Now a comrade of Toretto, Hobbs becomes more relaxed when in the company of Dominic and his crew, as seen during his time with Tej Parker at car auction. Hobbs is willing to request help from the outside when dealing with criminals and target that are perhaps too capable for him to handle alone. One example being Toretto's crew. Despite this he doesn't see them as expendable pawns and does what he can to look out for their well-being. One example was when he tagged Toretto's car when he went out searching for Letty, which ended up saving his life. Hobbs's closest partnership was with that of Elena Neves, who joined the Diplomatic Security Service and worked alongside Hobbs following the incident in Rio. He later demonstrated immense loyalty to Toretto's crew, risking self-harm after being hospitalized for injuries sustained while fighting Deckard Shaw, to help them apprehend Shaw and stop Mose Jakande when they entered in Los Angeles."
Dwayne Johnson,"As a father, he trusts Elena to look after his daughter, Samantha. Hobbs communicates freely with his daughter, perhaps divulging minor details of his work such as the people he meets, like Dominic Toretto, without comprising his job or endangering his daughter. Hobbs is often condescending and belittling of criminals and opponents. Whether or not his opponents fall the bait is largely dependent on their self control and position within a circumstance. Hobbs is prideful and rarely shows modesty, but often has the skill and ability to back up his disparaging commentary and ability to adapt to situations."
Dwayne Johnson,Hobbs subscribes to the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche and Bruce Lee.
Jesse Eisenberg,"Being extremely intelligent, eccentric, self-conscious, ambitious, courageous, and charismatic, Lex is actually the ultimate living personification of intellectualism, quite possibly the greatest mind in the world (in many ways considerably intellectually superior to even most geniuses), using this tremendous power as an altruistic humanist, a man of and for the people (with Lex comparing himself to the enlightening gift-giving figure of Prometheus, and supporting it well with his superb demagogic skills). While he would appear an ideal image of human perfection, this nature of his is tainted to a hideous degree by his horrifically unstable ego deriving from his high horse and low morality derived from a cruel and traumatic upbringing, meaning Lex has little inhibition about seeing the world prosper only as he sees fit. the mad genius's ultimate wish, aside from power sought to better humanity according to his own wisdom, is to destroy those that he deems as competition - namely his main nemesis Superman, who he foresees destroying humanity altogether in part due to direct contradiction of his own desire to elevate [man] to our peak, although he also feels (much less) threatened by metahumans in general (specifically Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg of the Justice League) and so puts a lot of effort into keeping close tabs on them. Furthermore, Lex's ruthless attempts to prevent Superman from ever having apocalyptic ramifications imply psychopathy, as the methods he implements are extremely immoral and vehemently ruthless, with the billionaire having little to no real care for the tactics used to achieve his goals, nor their impact upon others, so he is actually the ultimate embodiment of a utilitarian ""the ends justify the means"" mindset, as he (unlike Bruce Wayne) knows not whether something as extreme as the Knightmare will come to be, but not caring. This is shown when he confesses that he detests not Superman himself, but the theoretical apocalyptic scenario, before citing his mere presence is making bad things happen, meaning simply existing makes the presence of Kal-El sinful in Lex's eyes, an oxymoron. Feeling threatened on a personal level because of what Superman's power means for him, and on an external level because of how Superman's attachment to his mother and girlfriend are his extremely conditional reasons for wanting to keep the world in one piece, Lex is envious and bitter enough to openly describe the former in infernal and diabolical terms, subtly comparing Superman to a werewolf (by referring to kryptonite as a ""silver bullet""), a ""flying demon"" (which he uses to justify his threat of ruthlessly burning Martha Kent alive), and finally, to the biblical Satan himself, who had originated not in ""Hell beneath [Lex],"" but had come ""from the sky"" (as a fallen archangel), inducing humanity to admire him. Lex shares similar sentiments towards metahumans in general, though colloquially addressing them as ""the basis of [humanities] myths,"" ""exceptional beings"" and ""gods among men"" living on Earth. As he highlighted the notion of planetary security to Senator Finch, Lex also categorized the danger presented in their presence, citing them in the same vein of diabolism as Superman, stating if [the government] forged their silver bullet but didn't use it then ""[mankind] won't have to depend on the kindness of monsters."""
Jesse Eisenberg,"This immense fear and hatred of powerful individuals with popularity seemingly stems from the great amounts of apprehension and resentment that Lex harbors for his late father, Alexander Luthor Sr., as the latter, while both powerful and popular, was extremely cruel and egregious behind closed doors, physically abusing his young and helpless son with both fists and ""abominations."" Thus, Lex's experiences of abuse, without any intervention from no ""man in the sky,"" immensely traumatized him, which in turn induces Lex to gain a militantly misotheistic view of God, believing that if God were omnipotent, then his benevolence logically could not be absolute and vice versa (the theological problem of evil), thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent (referring to the antithesis of that as the ""oldest lie in America"")."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Somewhat ironically, despite his misotheism, Lex has a penchant for constantly implementing allusions to major figures of both pagan and biblical theology, with him notably comparing himself to Prometheus, General Zod to Icarus, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah, and Satan. He even compares himself to the biblical God in one way, claiming albeit insightfully to hate ""the sin, not the sinner,"" and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday. When making these allusions, however, Lex tends to cast these theologies' supreme gods in a not very discreet negative light (expertly finding the right myths for that, as he did with Zeus' punishment of Prometheus), to the point that Wonder Woman was visibly enraged by Lex's description of Zeus and the Old Gods."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Ironically, while the egregious abuse would make Lex immensely despise his father, he would eventually come to share some of his father's traits as an adult, though it could be argued that Lex took all of these traits even further, as he would notably become more intelligent, skilled, relentless, and powerful than his father had ever been. However, this is hard to pin down as little is known about Luthor Sr. at all. Hence, Lex projects his childhood trauma and theological resentment onto the godlike Superman, determined to prove to both himself and to humanity at large that the alien superhero, while being supremely powerful, is actually not supremely good, and is in fact an abominable fraud. However, Lex notably does not have the same hatred towards General Zod, and actually seems to admire him, with Lex tearfully remarking that the latter had ""[flown] too close to the sun."" This is most likely due the fact that General Zod, unlike Superman, did not contradict Lex's worldview, due to Zod's godlike power being used for the benevolent intent of preserving a race rather than avenging a loved one."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Ultimately however, while Lex does somewhat admire General Zod, he proves himself to be a considerably greater enemy for Superman. Zod, after all, had initially tried to persuade Superman to side with him, and had genuinely cared for his allies (especially his closest and most trusted one, Faora-Ul), all while seeking to protect, save and resurrect what remained of his destroyed beloved world and his race. Lex, by contrast, is far more relentless and ruthless and pragmatic, as he instantly resolves to become enemies with Superman (viewing the latter's very existence as a ""sin""), was willing to become a supercriminal, committing unspeakable crimes against peace and humanity, all for the purpose of destroying his nemesis (and what the latter represents) to prevent the end of days, of proving his cynical ideology and points (based in the theological problem of evil), and of reaffirming his deluded, megalomaniacal godly self-image to himself, while ultimately being egregiously egotistical, not caring about anyone other than himself, as even Doomsday (Lex's own Frankensteinian creation, whom Lex thought of as a surrogate son of sorts[15][16]) was ultimately disposable to him, being but means to an end. He did ensure Mercy Graves (Lex's closest and most trusted ally) wasn't killed, but it was probably nothing but pragmatism, so it is not a redeeming quality, especially since he still took a huge risk just to throw off Senator Finch. Still, their silver gleaming as their fervent and righteous determination to protect and preserve their race, with only their methods of doing so actually making them immoral. Lex even shows himself to enjoy a good fight, since right before Lex is about to ruthlessly have Senator Finch killed, and later when he threatens to ruthlessly burn Martha Kent alive, Lex actually manages to find both situations funny, and cracks several sinister black humor pun jokes, with gleeful sadism. In addition, while all of Superman's other haters and detractors were guilt-ridden following his death and mourned him, with even the exceptionally amoral Amanda Waller posthumously respecting him, while even the brutal and cynical Batman was inspired by him to better himself, Lex was as gleeful as ever, in utter defiance of himself being exposed as a super criminal and incarcerated in Belle Reve supermax."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Because of how complex his mind is and how young the man himself is, Lex has shown to have ticks implying moderate mental imbalance. This is shown by him rubbing his arm against a display case or drumming his fingers against a wall, although he has even been shown to have fits of psychotic frustration and rage when talking to a large group of people and not knowing what to say, due to his extremely convoluted mind being otherwise occupied at that moment. Hence, when Lois Lane pettily calls him ""psychotic,"" Lex smugly dismisses that word as merely referring to ""any thought too big for little minds."" Due to his aforementioned God complex he shares with Enchantress that only his way can bring order that lasts, Lex, despite his ability to kill Superman himself (with the acquired kryptonite), instead waits for the opportune moment to manipulate Superman and Batman into a fierce mortal duel, in order to first discredit the Man of Steel, so as to avoid Superman becoming a martyr, and to simultaneously humiliate Superman, by having a being of godlike power killed by an ordinary man (supported by Lex' many biblical allusions when gloatingly describing the heroes' planned mortal duel). Overall, while actually sane and only feigning insanity during his Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex had in fact grown increasingly unhinged, due to the existential crisis that opposing Superman induced within him.[15][16] Lex takes smug pride in his phenomenal intellect, usually sadistically thinking of others as his inferiors and pawns (managing to slyly reveal, for instance, that he is aware of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent's alter egos, without them realizing it, and smugly sneering at the prospect of knowing something that Batman doesn't when the latter ambushes him in Belle Reve), proudly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to outsmart and manipulate even the experienced tactical and detective genius Batman, in addition to claiming that the exceptionally smart and insightful Lois Lane has only a ""little mind"" compared to his. Indeed, Lex's reliance on intellect and contingencies make him far more effective than almost all other supervillains. Hence, like, Amanda Waller, Lex is a manipulative and devious leverager, but an even more effective one than her, as Lex relies on more than just leverage, and never allows leverage-based power to become his weakness. Just like Enchantress, Lex is driven purely by a single-minded desire to order things according to his own wisdom, akin to a God complex, though he consistently relies far more on intellect and plans, never allowing arrogance to become his weakness. Like General Zod, Lex is a ruthless and indomitable winner who refuses to lose, though even more effective, due to not being limited by thinking boundaries or dogmatic tunnel vision. Like the Joker, Lex bears a penchant for unspeakable crimes, though far more covert and implicit, and hence far more successful at keeping those crimes from getting tied to him, although his crimes are also committed for the greater good as opposed to anarchy for its own sake. Like Ares, Lex is an incredible deceiver who covertly manipulates his enemies and superbly hides in plain sight, though he has a greater number of contingencies planned. Finally, Lex is as intelligent as his nemesis Superman is powerful, making Lex a worthy opponent for him, more than capable of gaining the upper hand against the mighty alien, despite his own lack of metahuman powers."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Still, Lex was ultimately a heroic, enlightening, and altruistic humanist, even comparing himself to humanity's savior Prometheus, since Lex does indeed actually firmly believe in the importance of bettering humankind to its peak, and Lex claims that he wants to ""elevate the right people, the right human people"" in order to ""leave the planet in better shape for the next generation, to make the world and its children safer.[4]"" Indeed, his LexCorp Industries mission statement is: ""Let's build a better tomorrow today,"" while the specified one for Lex/Os is: ""Help us build a more human system.[17]"" Due to Batman epitomizing many of these humanist beliefs (having bettered himself both mentally and physically to his peak, without any superhuman assistance, making him capable of pulling off terrific feats without actually being superhuman), Lex genuinely admires him, despite Batman being his enemy and business rival, and Lex therefore selects the tremendously skilled vigilante to be his champion against Superman and the metahumans. Lex does not, however, view Batman as an equal, as he takes pride in his intellectual superiority, smugly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to deceive the vigilante into unknowingly becoming his pawn after he had awkwardly thrown aside his spear and agreed to help Superman. Lex appears to respect Deathstroke for similar reasons. Lex is phenomenally brilliant in sciences and business, as well as tactics and strategy (to the point that he boldly claims not to know how to lose), and is thereby practically always the smartest man in a room."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Lex is also incredibly brave, almost completely fearless, showing no signs of fear when confronted by an angry Superman, and even when unexpectedly ambushed in his Belle Reve supermax jail cell and at the mercy of a furious Batman with a branding ring (although Lex's sneer momentarily disappeared when Batman informed him about his transfer to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane), with Lex going so far as smugly sneering at Batman's threats, gloating over Superman's death with gleeful sadism, and equally sadistically warning Batman about the imminent coming of a new, mysterious alien invader, Darkseid, to whom Earth is now vulnerable to, due to Superman's death, although he may have simply intended to do all in his current power to goad him into bringing superheroes together."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Lex does, however, have several prominent fears, the biggest of which, even more than that of losing his own life, being his fear of losing intellectual power and self-righteous control, so yet another factor of Lex's resentment towards Superman was his outrage over the latter not deserving his godlike power (a legitimate claim), while feeling that instead, he is the one that deserves it, due to Lex being a self-made man (amassing his supergenius intellect, building up LexCorp Industries, and earning himself a phenomenal fortune in a superhuman business feat) from a difficult and traumatic upbringing. Indeed, due to this existential sense of entitlement, Lex epitomizes the Easterlin Paradox - being absolutely tormented, miserable, and full of rage, despite also being tremendously rich and successful[15][16] Therefore, Lex values control above all else, so much so, that he places himself above Superman, and almost asks Superman to tear him apart, in their first confrontation. Hence, when confronted with his greatest fear, Lex shows himself to be a fatalist, as he used Doomsday as his last-ditch effort to destroy his nemesis, although he knew the damage wrought in the Skirmish under Gotham Harbor was dwarfed by the Insurgency."
Jesse Eisenberg,"While Lex's god complex does occasionally make him arrogant and overconfident, this weakness of his (unlike with supervillains like Ares, Enchantress, General Zod, General Ludendorff, or Amanda Waller) is ultimately an insignificant one, as Lex's tremendous intellect and cold calculation allow him to very effectively compensate for this at almost all times, mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even though he does express a level of shock whenever one of his plans fail and he has to resort to one of his less ethical contingencies, he is very quick to recover from it. Hence, when Senator Finch unexpectedly refuses to grant Lex an import license for the Indian Ocean kryptonite, he promptly smuggles it in instead; when a guilt-ridden Kahina Ziri unexpectedly confesses her lies to Finch, Lex promptly has them both killed; when Batman and Superman unexpectedly stop their duel, team up and save Martha Kent, Lex promptly unleashes Doomsday upon them, killing Superman; when Lex's numerous unspeakable crimes get exposed and result in Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex promptly makes himself unfit to stand trial by convincingly feigning insanity; and when Lex learns of his unexpected transfer to Arkham Asylum, he regains his confidence mere seconds later, due to Lex having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out from Arkham (and subsequent retreat to a contingency private yacht) at the optimal time. Even after Superman is resurrected from the dead more powerful than before and cements together the Justice League, Lex is as confident as ever in face of this greater challenge, and swiftly chooses this as the optimal time to escape Arkham, retreats to the contingency yacht, and meets up with Deathstroke to discuss moving against the Batman."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Hence overall, Lex Luthor is extremely unpredictable, as he often has numerous back-up plans to his back-up plans, accounting for numerous possible scenarios with efficient contingencies. Indeed, Lex's unparalleled ability to plan, strategize, restrategize, and break down his opponents grants him power that surpasses even that of Superman and metahumans, since Lex's ability to predict and gather information on his many opponents allows him to easily outstrategize any of them one-on-one, thereby making it almost impossible for them to succeed against Lex. As a result, Lex caught both Batman and Superman off-guard with the revelation of his endgame - Doomsday. Even Lex's personal assistant, confidant, and right-hand woman Mercy Graves, who knew him best, was ultimately not privy to all of Lex's master plans, and therefore was unable to correctly predict his future actions."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Much like his archenemy Superman, Lex has tremendous determination and strength of will, since he absolutely refuses to ever hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds, with Lex mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even going so far as to claim that he doesn't know how to lose. Indeed, Lex even resolves to dominate in something as trivial as a bowling game with Ron Troupe.[4] Hence, Lex managed to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), and being willing to use illegal operations to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire. Later, despite the seemingly impossible task of bringing down the godlike Superman without having metahuman powers himself, Lex refuses to back down from it, and resolves to utilize his phenomenal intellect to devise complex and intricate plans to bring down his archenemy, along with back-up plans, and back-up plans to his back-up plans, for good measure, with Lex ultimately succeeding in defeating and killing Superman and preventing the Knightmare with his personal Frankensteinian creation Doomsday."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Lex carries out this self-righteous plan with cold calculation and ruthless cruelty, being quick to murder anyone who gets in his way, such as the militantly oppositional Senator Finch, his guilt-ridden pawn Kahina Ziri, his unsuspecting pawns Jimmy Olsen and Cesar Santos, his no longer useful pawns Senator Barrows and Wallace Keefe (along with the 66 other attendees of Superman's hearing[16]), and Amajagh's Nairomian soldiers are likewise shown to be disposable to Lex, as she is likewise killed off along with them. Lex even goes so far as to sadistically threaten to burn the kidnapped Martha Kent alive unless Superman ""bows to [his] will"" by killing Batman. This meticulous and brilliant plan behind Lex's ultimatum was to expose the theological problem of evil in Superman regardless of the fight's outcome - if Superman were to win and kill Batman (to save his mother's life) he would prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman were to lose (due to holding back and his weakness to kryptonite) to Batman and die, he would prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful. He was pragmatic enough to let his loyal assistant Mercy Graves live, but only because he wanted to keep using her."
Jesse Eisenberg,"In the meantime, Lex continues to better himself and accordingly gain more power, being quick to order the Fortress of Solitude to teach him all about the knowledge from 100,000 alien worlds, thereby expanding his already brilliant mind to supergenius level, finally becoming even more godlike in his own eyes. Despite the failure of his initial grand plan, Lex's far more grand and extreme contingency plan of unleashing Doomsday succeeds, with Superman seemingly being killed by the bloodthirsty monster. Indeed, Lex appears to be so satisfied with his success (as he claims not to know how to lose), that he cares little about being imprisoned for his numerous illegal deeds shortly thereafter, and gleefully awaits the imminent arrival of Darkseid."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Lex also has a somewhat dry, black, and sadistic sense of humor (similar to that of the Joker and General Ludendorff), and love for both witty puns and visual metaphors, shown when Lex mockingly imitated a Kentucky accent when speaking with Senator Finch; when Lex told the wheelchair-bound Wallace Keefe that he wanted to help the latter ""stand"" for something; when Lex claims that the shortest road to Superman is ""Lois lane""; when Lex mentions ""civilizations of the wane, manners out the window"" to Batman (subtly revealing that he knows of Bruce Wayne being the Dark Knight's alter ego); when Lex had a jar of urine placed upon Senator Finch's desk, labelled ""Granny's Peach Tea"" (illustrating an epithet that she herself had used against him not along ago) before coldly murdering her with a hidden bomb; and when Lex described the upcoming battles between Superman and Batman, and later Superman and Doomsday with dramatic and sadistic glee, mockingly incorporating antique and theological metaphors (such as describing the first battle as the ""greatest gladiator match in the history of the world""). In addition, Lex seems to be well-versed in American pop-culture, making quite a few references from it as well, notably ""The Midnight Ride,"" ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Lolita"" and the ""Wizard of Oz."" Following his incarceration in Belle Reve and the shaving of his head, Lex retained his sadism, but also paired it with a far more confident, cold and calculating attitude than before, in contrast to his previous darkly humorous persona."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Atlas visits the Eye, saying that he is tiredN of waiting for instructions from Dylan. They have been hiding for over a year and he wants to do something. Later, Atlas returns home and finds a magician named Lula May there. She reveals that she knows all about the Four Horsemen and then pretends to have her head cut off. Later, Dylan reveals that she is the new member of the Four Horsemen, replacing Henley. Dylan gives them an assignment to return to the stage and expose corrupt businessman Owen Case, whose new software secretly steals data on its users for Case's benefit."
Jesse Eisenberg,"The show is stopped when the lights turn off and a face reveals that Jack is still alive and that Dylan is the Fifth Horsemen. Atlas, Merritt, Jack, and Lula all go to the roof and slide down a tube that was supposed to lead them to an escape bus. However, they land in Macau, China, where Merritt's twin brother, Chase McKinney, is waiting for them. His men bring the Four Horsemen to a building where they find Walter Mabry waiting for them. He explains how they were sent to China and says that they have to steal a computing device that is the key to every computer system on the planet. It was called the ""stick"". Jack, Merritt, and Lula refuse, but Atlas agrees because in America, they were criminals, but in China, they could go unrecognized."
Jesse Eisenberg,"The Four Horsemen successfully steal the stick, hiding it on the back of a playing card. Meanwhile, Dylan springs Thaddeus from prison and Thaddeus tells him that the Horsemen are in Macau. They go there and Atlas tells Dylan that he isn't the leader of the Horsemen anymore and if he wanted to help them, he would leave. Walter confronts Atlas and tells him to give him the stick. Atlas refuses and Dylan grabs him. He takes the stick from Atlas and shoves him through the door. However, Atlas later reaches into his pocket and sees that he still has the stick."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Walter's men capture Dylan and they put him in the safe in which his father died. They drop the safe in the water, hoping that Dylan would drown and die the same way his father did. However, Dylan is able to pick the lock and escape the safe just as it fills up with water. Atlas jumps in and brings him to the surface, saving his life. Dylan explains that he took the stick from Atlas and when he threw Atlas out the door, he slipped it back in his pocket. He, the Four Horsemen, Li, and Bu Bu team up to take Walter down."
Jesse Eisenberg,"They all set up tricks around London. Atlas does a trick in which he stops the rain from pouring, freezing it in mid-air. He makes it go up and back to normal. He later reveals that the trick was done with rain machines and strobe lights and tells the audience to remember how he did the trick for the final. He, Lula, Dylan, Jack, and Merritt are later captured and put on Walter's plane. They threaten to kill Lula, and Atlas then gives him the stick. All five of them are thrown out of the plane and are presumably killed. But then, they see the Horsemen out their plane window."
Jesse Eisenberg,"It is revealed that the plane had never taken off. Walter, Arthur, and Chase were tricked into believing they had taken off because of machines that had simulated flying in the sky and the driver of the plane had been replaced. Their criminal activities were broadcast to live audiences around the world and they are arrested. Dylan and the Four Horsemen visit Li's secret library. Thaddeus joins them and they all walk into a secret chamber, which leads to a spiral staircase shaped as the Eye, and they disappear."
Jesse Eisenberg,"Casey Davies was a normal if pathetic man who one day was beaten down by a group of bikers. After this, he became very fearful, deciding to learn karate for self defense. This proved to be a very poor decision after he decided to join the exclusive night class, getting involved in several violent and horrific activities."
Jesse Eisenberg,"From his flashback, Columbus seems to have no social life, although he seemed well-versed with meaningless trivia related to food products and games. However, he is quite clever, knowing how to make a situation work for him; he'll slyly interrogate someone or trick them. Surviving through Zombieland, Columbus' courage hasn't increased much, but only when Wichita came into the picture does he find the strength to ""Be A Hero"", ignoring his own safety rules. He is quite shy about revealing his feelings, often ending up embarrassed when it comes to Wichita. Referring to his cleverness again, Columbus has lasted longer than any of the other people surviving Zombieland thanks to observations and good deductions."
Hugh Jackman,"Logan appears to be the ultimate personification of manliness and masculinity. While he appears to be perpetually angry, he is a rather complicated man, due to his violent and mysterious past. He has very little patience for those around him, this adds to his gruff demeanor and solo attitude. Indeed, Logan prefers to be alone due to him disliking and distrusting the company of others. Despite his disgruntled nature, he has a very dry sense of humor, constantly insulting others and giving them demeaning nicknames. Logan does not hesitate to harm or kill and harbors no true remorse or guilt over any violent actions he has done in the past, with the exception of Jean Grey in the erased timeline.[9] His past has in fact emotionally scarred and hardened him to make himself used to the pain and suffering he has endured, from his childhood trauma,[1] to his several lifetimes of being a soldier in many of the most violent wars in modern history. His is therefore less inclined to show mercy towards his opponents, anyone else that attacks him, or even those who simply anger him, such as when he tried to kill Noburo Mori since he was corrupt and part of Mariko's kidnapping to be paid a fortune."
Hugh Jackman,"Despite his willingness to use violence, he is still a moral person who does not do so needlessly, nor does he attack innocent people. While he is described as cynical and pessimistic, Logan is nonetheless a good person and will always stand up for those who can't defend themselves, or at the very least be willing to avenge them, as such as his killing of Agent Zero for attacking him and killing the elderly couple that sheltered him.[1] While hiding in a well from the Nagasaki nuclear bombing, he was not fazed by the destruction going on outside since he could do nothing about it, but was willing to save Ichirō Yashida when he had the chance to, unable to leave the man to his fate. However, Yashida proved himself to be evil and repeatedly tried to kill Logan and gain his healing as Silver Samurai, Logan tore the suit open, pulling the wires that kept Yashida alive, before stabbing his chest and dropped him off a cliff to his death in a rage.[10] Logan has grown some restraint and perhaps mercy over the yearspresumably because of his prolonged exposure to the X-Men. Although he has no restraint or regret for unleashing his animal side on those deserving of such violence, he at least nonlethally incapacitated the Pentagon guards whilst attempting to free Magneto with Charles and Beast."
Hugh Jackman,"Although officially an X-Man, Logan prefers to be alone. He has a deep distrust and disrespect for people, regardless of whether they are both human and mutant, having seen nearly 200 years of violence, prejudice, and war.[3] This attitude also stems from having people he trusted betray him, such as Kayla and his brother, Victor. However, the true reason for Logan's wanting to be alone is due to the fact that so many people tend to die around him, such as friends and loved ones.[1] He also shows signs of self loathing for the violent life he has lived and the pain he has endured."
Hugh Jackman,"Logan is extremely loyal and protective over those few who can gain his trust and respect. He is completely ready to sacrifice his life if it will save someone he loves, and will stop at nothing to protect his friends and family.[1] Despite his blunt personality, Logan has made many friends with the X-Men, but most notably Rogue, becoming almost a father-figure to her, after realizing that both of them are outcasts.[3] His is also one of Xavier's most trusted allies, with Xavier even having a mentor kind of role to Logan. He grew attached to Charles to the point of breaking down when he was disintegrated by Dark Phoenix.[11] He was also greatly attached to Mariko Yashida, having found a chance of happiness with her, to the point of risking his life to defend her while his healing factor was disabled, fight an army of Black Clan ninjas, even torture a member of the Yakuza to find her."
Hugh Jackman,"Logan is a man of vice; he loves to drink alcohol and smoke cigars, knowing that neither can effect his health due to his powers.[1][7] He is also an adamant motorcycle rider and has shown to hate flying in planes."
Hugh Jackman,"His most famous traits would be his temper and attitude. Logan seems constantly angry and is very easy to become enraged. Though he is capable of thought, he has said himself that he has an animal side to his personality. This side of him is feral and primal, causing him to become instinctual and berserk, especially in combat. It is caused by his animalistic mutation and triggered by anger, fear, frustration, great annoyance, general distress or pain. It result in him becoming highly aggressive and mindlessly brutal, similar to an animal, as he is prone to roar with rage in most of these cases. In some cases, it is this brute-like side of Logan that make it easy for him kill and harm without hesitation."
Hugh Jackman,"By the events of 2029, having long since lost all of his loved ones (excluding Charles) combined with his gradually weakening body, Logan's outlook on life became bleak at best. More hostile than ever, Logan cares little for helping others and seeks only to find a small measure of personal peace, becoming a drifter on the sea. With his healing powers so weak that he is no longer immune to toxins, he has taken solace in drinking. However, upon learning of his estranged biological daughter Laura and a series of events to help her, Wolverine ultimately regains his compassion and hope from years ago."
Hugh Jackman,"For several years, if not decades, Sir Lionel Frost had been studying zoology and mythology, especially the myths surrounding fantastic creatures, which lead to him becoming a crypto-zoologist and an adventurer. He would spend several years searching for such creatures in order to confirm his research and in order to be accepted in the English Adventurers Club, in London. He is, however, constantly turned down by the club's leader, Lord Piggot-Dunceby, because of his constant failures to capture a specimen, but more importantly, for believing in mythical creatures to begin with. On his many exploits Frost would be accompanied by a personal valet/sidecick, who would often leave him for Frost having put them in dangerous situations. Some such attendents would die during his expiditions. His latest assistent, Lemuel Lint personally quit his employment after nearly having been eaten by The Loch Ness Monster."
Hugh Jackman,"As the film starts, Sir Lionel Frost, after failing to photograph The Loch Ness Monster, receives a letter from an anonymous writer who claims to have proven the existence of Big Foot/Sasquatch in the forests of the Pacific Northwest states of America, and has invited Frost to visit him there. With his enthusiasm rekindled, Sir Frost goes to the Adventure's Club to try and present his evidence. But Lord Piggot-Dunceby once again dismiss his claims as nothing more then flytes of fancys. Worse still, he objects to Frost's claims that the existence of a Sasquatch would prove the evolutionary theory of man's evolution, proclaiming that ""the English are descended from great MEN, not great APES!"" Not wonting to give up on his dream, Sir Frost proposes a wager to Lord Piggot-Dunceby: if Frost brings back accurate evidence to prove the Big Foot's existence then Lord Piggot-Dunceby will have to except his invitation into the club. But should Frost come back empty handed then Frost will never try to join them again. And with that Lord Piggot-Dunceby accepts the deal and Frost heads up to America in search of the creature."
Patrick Stewart,"Drago was a very wise and noble dragon with a strong sense of humour and also loyal to his friends. He saw Gareth as a potential knight for soul instead of class. He was also shown to be moody as shown when Gareth presumed he lay the eggs he broguht, and when he and Lorne presumed he was unable to understand proper human sentences."
Patrick Stewart,"In Dragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire, Drago also proved to be selfless even though it cost him his life, when Edric and a dying Meghan wanted him to take back his life source, his Heartfire, so he would live, but he urged them to use the last of it to save Meghan's life before his soul went up into the dragon heaven within the constellation Draco."
Patrick Stewart,"Xavier has built a lifetime reputation on being caring and compassionate to his fellow mutants. Even as a child, he helped a young Mystique find her place in the world. He refuses to give up on people, always believing they can be saved, as seen in Mystique, Jean Grey and even his ""arch rival"" Magneto. His greatest attribute is his ability to believe in hope and to never give up no matter the odds."
Patrick Stewart,"Throughout his adult life Xavier has taught and trained mutants, to not only deal with their abilities but more importantly how to live in and cope in a world that fears them. He became a mentor and father figure to many mutants, giving them a home when many were lost. Even Lehnsherr, his long-time rival, holds Xavier in very high regard, knowing everything he's done for mutant."
Patrick Stewart,"However, Xavier was not always so hopeful and heroic. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the loss of Raven, his legs, his students and his friend Erik was too much for him, and he hid away from the world in the mansion. Xavier had lost hope and became addicted to Hank McCoy's serum that returned him his legs, refusing to let his powers return and overwhelm him. It took the combined efforts of Wolverine and the future Xavier to return him to his usual heroic personality by showing him all the good he will do, and all the suffering that could be prevented"
Patrick Stewart,"There are also moments when Xavier reveals a more manipulative aspect of himself, such as when he placed psychic blocks on Jean Grey's powers out of fear that she would be uncontrollable, or when he defies his own code of only using his powers on a willing subject, such as Mystique or Magneto. When controlling certain aspects of those around him he firmly believes that it is for their own good, refusing to acknowledge or listen to the consequences this can have, a trait which led to Jean destroying his original body and him and Mystique becoming estranged, the latter of which Charles solely blamed Erik for until their reunion in 1973 when he finally admitted what controlling her had done."
Patrick Stewart,"Unlike most mutants, Xavier does not hate humans, believing that mutants and humans can find a way to coexist, and he will not risk human lives any more than he would a mutant's. While preferring more diplomatic solutions, Xavier isn't afraid to be forceful, but only if it is the last resort.[3] In the revised timeline, his ability to condone violence to the sake of defending his students and other innocents is greatly increased after defeating Apocalypse, enough to impress and satisfy Erik, who saw him as naive and foolish for being so trusting of people in the past and not being truly willing to fight."
Patrick Stewart,"Xavier has deep and complex relationships with many of the main X-Men characters. Both he and Erik Lehnsherr have a very complicated history, fighting each other over several decades, and yet there is still an almost brotherly connection between them. The two have spent many hours playing chess together and debating mutant affairs. Xavier and Raven Darkholme also have a complicated relationship, with Raven being almost like a sister for Xavier, despite her troubled past [3]. Hank McCoy is Charles' greatest ally, as he refused to give up on him, even when Charles had given up on himself. Logan's angry and self-centered attitude contrasts with Charles, but the two worked together to unlock the secrets of the former's mind, and eventually, Logan grew to see Xavier as a mentor-like figure and became one of his most loyal X-Men."
Patrick Stewart,"By 2029, Xavier had mostly lost his good nature. Having been hidden by Logan for numerous years in isolation, Charles spent his days randomly mumbling unless given his medication. When he had clarity, Charles was bitter, often swore and crazy. However, the last spark of his compassion was directed at Laura, who was Logan's genetic daughter; Xavier spent his last hours trying to help her escape from the Reavers and serving as a grandfather figure to Laura before enjoying time with the Munson family during his stay at their house. He also urged Logan to aid the Munsons' when their horses ran amuck and consciously used his powers for a final time to calm the horses, showing that his great mind was not completely gone yet."
Patrick Stewart,"In 1979, Bosley was awarded an honourary degree from Blackmoor College in after he assisted in solving the homicide of a student.[2] He is fluent in Latin.[3] Bosley studied roller skating with Gert when he was aspiring to be a roller derby skater."
Patrick Stewart,"As a Bosley, he did some field work but mostly he stayed in the office to organize Angel missions and reported to Charlie."
Patrick Stewart,"Although Bosley was originally one of Charlie's most trusted assistants, Charlie knew that he was not a reliable person and that he could take over the agency at any time. Thereafter, John spent the rest of his life being a field commander of The Angels, rather than succeeding Charlie as the head of the entire agency. He then orchestrates a plan to use frame his co-worker Rebekah, whom he despised all along, and turn The Angels against her so he could use them as a tool to hack the yet to be built Project: Calisto and he would eventually become an even more powerful leader for the agency than Charlie ever was. He pretends to be on The Angels' good side and commands them through an attack on the enemy forces, seemingly led by Rebekah, just in order to gain trust and receive information about the design of Project: Calisto. However, one of John's co-workers, Edgar, insists that Project: Calisto is too dangerous for use as it can cause fatal seizers on the enemies and cause potential damage even on the innocent people around the area. John however decides to use it anyway, and eventually, Elena Houghlin manages to build hack-able Calisto devices. John is proud of her inventions."
Patrick Stewart,"However, Rebekah is acknowledged of John's evil master plan and she steals Elena's equipment. The Angels then go to track and destroy Rebekah. However, John secretly hires an assassin called Hodak in order to kill his superiors. Hodak manages to kill Edgar and Peter Fleming, but he fails to kill Rebekah. Later, The Angels (aside from Elena) discover the truth about John's plans; he was plotting to hack the devices of Project: Calisto and use them for mass destruction so he could take over the agency and lead it instead of Rebekah and so that he could become the one leader to be more powerful than Charlie, and he could therefore prove the world how powerful and reliable he is. He later forces Elena into creating another device so he could use it to torture Langston and kill him. She questions him up until he reveals his true motives and threatens to kill her if she doesn't obey him. He later invites his associate Alexander Brock and Hodak to a ball gala, and he presents Project: Calisto to Brock as he manages to convince Brock to use it illegally for him. However, Elena eventually calls for help and The Angels manage to rescue both Elena and Langston. Brock is then ordered by Bosley to use the device on The Angels. However, the other agents of the Townsend Agency then ambush John's goons and Rebekah fights John. John almost chokes her to death, but Sabina Wilson manages to knock him out. After John recovers, he and Brock are arrested for conspiracy and presumably taken into custody."
Patrick Stewart,"Nettlebrand is often shown to be a cruel but cunning villain in the first novel; learning from his last failed hunt - 150 years prior to the novel's events - he would wait patiently until one silver dragon would lead him to the rest of their herd. During those long 150 years, Nettlebrand had often ventured to villages and towns to terrorize the residents and devour anyone or thing that opposed him; in the stories Twigleg is forced to recount, they were described as ""acts of heroism"", despite the fact they are anything but. It wasn't until Gravelbeard (a mountain dwarf) informed Nettlebrand about the recent sighting of Firedrake, who had just landed near his castle. Firedrake was resting during the day, but it was no thanks to Sorrel's shoddy navigation that landed them and Ben (a recent addition at the time) within the castle's line-of-sight."
Patrick Stewart,"Never the less, Nettlebrand anointed Twigleg to spy on Firedrake and his passengers, with Gravelbeard being ""rewarded"" with the position of being his new armor cleaner; he was apathetic towards Twigleg for being three days late to reporting in on the whereabouts of Firedrake, until learning of the archaeologist Barnabas Greenbloom who had acquired two of his three missing scales, upon which he became agitated that his scales were in the possession of a human. As for Gravelbeard, he was berated for having even less details about his tales of so-called ""heroism"" than Twigleg."
Patrick Stewart,"Three of Nettlebrand's known abilities is being able to use any body of liquid as a means of communication to his Enchanted Ravens, or even to translocate from one location to another, in addition to his scales being passively scentless and ice-cold, as revealed by Firedrake and The Serpent in that order. In two cases, he had used water from within a deep well to confront Barnabas in the Asian deserts, and retreat just as easily despite the size difference; in another case, Nettlebrand and Gravelbeard had to gather their spit into a carved-out cactus to communicate to his Ravens. Ironically, the cactus in question was bit by Nettlebrand beforehand in a fit of rage; the needles stuck to his tongue and gums as a reminder that he is not as insulated from harm on the inside."
Michael Keaton,"Before being thrown out of business by Tony Stark and Damage Control, Toomes was apparently a hard-working man who supported his family honestly. However, after being thrown out of business, he developed a dislike for the wealthy and privileged, believing that they do not care about the working class. Needing money to support this family, he became a ruthless and calculating man who was willing to commit crimes to do whatever it takes to support his family. Outside of his new criminal career Toomes continues to be an ordinary family man."
Michael Keaton,"Despite his criminal career, Toomes makes it a point not to get his family involved in any of his black market business nor does he want them to find out by staying off the Avengers' radar for years. Despite his intense hatred towards Stark, Toomes does not actively seek revenge against him either because it would draw attention from the Avengers towards his activities. He was fully prepared to quit his criminal career should his family be close to finding out or if his operations were discovered. Upon being arrested, Toomes asked his wife and daughter to move to Oregon so that they wouldn't have to see his trial and incarceration either."
Michael Keaton,"Initially, Toomes was annoyed by Spider-Man and tried multiple times to get the young hero out of his way, his realistic worldview clashing with Spider-Man's boundless idealism. Nevertheless he was impressed by the hero's sheer determination and to some degree stubbornness. However, after his daughter was saved by Spider-Man, and learning that he was actually Peter Parker, Liz's date, he gradually developed a sense of respect for him and even tried to convince him to join his side. When Toomes and Parker were alone in his car, he offered Parker the chance to end their feud in a peaceful manner if Spider-Man agreed not to further interfere with his plans, however; he was still willing to kill him if he continues to fight him."
Michael Keaton,"Toomes proved to still be an honorable man, as after Spider-Man ruined his operations and put him in prison, he showed some degree of gratefulness towards Parker for saving his life and his daughter's by pretending he hadn't figured out Spider-Man's secret identity yet when asked by Mac Gargan about it."
Michael Keaton,"Vandevere is a corrupt businessman, who runs an amusement park in Arkansas named Dreamland. As a persuasive entrepreneur who sets his sights on Max Medici's circus and its newest, miraculous member — a flying elephant, all he can see are dollar signs. He plans to make Dumbo a big star in Dreamland by pairing him with a stunning aerialist named Colette Marchant. With his eye on the prize, nothing and nobody can stop hi"
Michael Keaton,"To his corrupt actions, he is shown to be a ruthless park owner who refuses to let Dumbo reunite with his mother, Mrs. Jumbo. He also shows no safety to Colette, telling her that nets are only for rehearsal, much to his harshness. In addition during the climax, he also retaliates against one of the engineers inside the control center of Dreamland."
Jason Momoa,"Initially, Arthur Curry was a very conflicted individual, struggling with the fact that he has superhuman powers which he didn't know how to handle, but he was later trained by his mentor Nuidis Vulko. Arthur grew up feeling alienated from both the human and Atlantean worlds, feeling trapped between them, yet having the responsibility of protecting both.[4] In addition, Arthur was very bitter at his mother Atlanna for abandoning him and his father Thomas Curry. Arthur was thus somewhat gruff and reserved, unwilling to accept his place in Atlantean society, and also unwilling to accept Bruce Wayne's offer to join the Justice League at first, as well as getting annoyed with the young and quirky Flash.[4] Surely, Arthur had previously reached an emotional rock bottom during this period in his life, even claiming that he had no concern for the ocean, and by extension, his own people."
Jason Momoa,"Arthur hides his insecurities and troubled past behind a tough intimidating attitude, choosing to alienate himself from others and almost never showing any sympathy towards anyone. However, he can be more relaxed and friendly around those he trusts and is close to, such as his father and Mera."
Jason Momoa,"Despite his somewhat gloomy and fearsome exterior, however, Arthur is ultimately a selfless and compassionate person, indicated by him frequenting an Icelandic fishing village during the winter in order to feed its hungry inhabitants with fish. He is later seen saving an unconscious fisherman found along the shore, bringing him into the shelter of a local pub in the village. However, he casually shrugged it off by stating that his drinks would be on the fisherman. He also notably made it his priority to keep the innocent civilians of Sicily out of harm's way when fighting Black Manta. Arthur also showed compassion towards his half-brother Orm, whom he refused to kill despite the multiple atrocious actions Orm had committed. He also showed guilt over letting David Kane's father die and leading him to become the Black Manta."
Jason Momoa,"When confronted by Mera, Aquaman initially pushes back against her reprimands, but upon learning that his mother Atlanna did not abandon him of her own free will, he begins to have a change of heart. After being unable to stop Steppenwolf from retrieving the Atlanteans' Mother Box, Arthur's mind is finally made up and he joins the Justice League. He still clashes with Batman, Flash, and Cyborg a few times, but otherwise gets along with the team fairly well, eventually befriending them."
Jason Momoa,"Arthur, while outwardly very serious, occasionally demonstrates a dry sense of humor, notably complimenting Batman on the latter's vigilante suit. When failing to intimidate Bruce due to the latter's profound experience in intimidation tactics, Arthur quickly drops his façade, revealing his laid-back and charming self. While he initially distrusted the isolated Cyborg (suspecting that he could be working with the enemy, due to his Apokoliptian cybernetics), Aquaman gradually developed a friendship with him as well, seen when Cyborg assisted him in taking down a group of airborne Parademons. Aquaman is also somewhat of a realist, recognizing that he and the other Justice Leaguers could very well die in a battle against the New God Steppenwolf, and agreeing with Wonder Woman that resurrecting Superman with a Mother Box is too risky"
Jason Momoa,"Despite his gruff appearance and devil-may-care approach to battle, Arthur is quite intelligent and introspective, notably when he quotes Friedrich Schiller's William Tell to Bruce when asked to join the League, stating that 'the strong man is strongest alone', thus further emphasizing his preferred isolation from the surface world, and later quoting Jules Verne when describing the extreme unlikelihood of his parents' successful relationship. When bound by the Lasso of Hestia, Aquaman reveals that deep down, he is very grateful for the team's acceptance, and even developed a crush on Wonder Woman, despite the Atlanteans having once warred against the Amazons. Arthur, upon his release, became dismayed upon realizing the circumstances of his confession and angrily forbade Flash from ever sharing it with anyone."
Jason Momoa,"Arthur is clearly a thrill-seeker who enjoys adventuring, displayed when he enthusiastically slew Parademons alongside the Justice League and when he was introduced to his homeworld of Atlantis. He'll often employ words such as ""badass"" and ""awesome"" to describe his experiences, and even whooping in excitement when he jumped after Mera from a cargo plane without a parachute."
Amber Heard,"Dedicated and compassionate, Mera has a somewhat intimidating exterior but is still understanding (compared to other Atlanteans) and caring once she can trust someone. As Atlantean royalty, Mera was raised with a strong sense of duty to her people and country, and as such will honor her duty above her own emotions if her position requires it. For example, she was willing to marry Orm (despite her not loving him) to fulfill her duty as a Xebelian princess. Above all, however, she believes in doing what is right and ultimately best for Atlantis, which initially is why she begrudgingly works with Arthur Curry in order to prevent the harm that will come from Orm's proposed war."
Amber Heard,"Upon first encounters, Mera can come off as standoffish or stubborn, but this is often a result of her determination to reach her goals. Underneath this hard exterior, Mera is actually quite selfless and caring, as seen when she saved Thomas Curry from Orm's Tsunami and tended to Arthur's wounds from his fight with Black Manta."
Amber Heard,"In her role as a warrior, Mera is also brave and quick-thinking. She led the Atlantean forces protecting their Mother Box during Steppenwolf's invasion of Earth, and also outwitted several Atlantean soldiers after being attacked in Sicily. Outside of combat, she is also shown to be inventive in tight situations, such as when she thought to use Arthur's sweat to reactivate ancient Atlantean technology and manipulated wine with her hydrokinetic powers and was even smart enough to memorize and destroy an encoded message so that it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands, with Arthur not thinking that far ahead. As a result of this quick-thinking, however, she can also be a bit impulsive, such as when she jumped out of a plane without a parachute, intervened during the Duel in the Ring of Fire, and stole a boat from an Italian marina."
Amber Heard,"Mera was initially somewhat abrasive towards Arthur, notably chastising the Atlantean when he disparaged his mother Atlanna, attributing to the fact that Mera bears lingering affection for the Queen, due to the latter raising and mentoring her akin to a daughter. During their quest to find the Trident of Atlan, however, Mera noticeably began to warm up to Arthur, to the point that she instinctively reached out for his hand when there was danger seemingly present, although they quickly parted hands in embarrassment. Unfamiliar with human customs, she also displayed wide-eyed glee and childlike curiousty when exploring Sicily, mistaking a bunch of roses for food upon witnessing some inhabitants eating red food, and likewise copying them. She also retains a playful and light-hearted side in contrast to her usually standoffish disposition, notably creating water-based dolphins from a fountain and manipulating them much to the delight of a little girl. This aspect of her personality eventually drew her ever closer to the fun-seeking Arthur, with the pair almost meeting lips before being attacked by Black Manta. This underlying romantic liaison would eventually culminate in her passionately kissing Arthur, before he was to engage Orm in combat. Following Arthur's victory, Mera proudly stood alongside her newfound love with dignity and poise, as he was finally hailed King of Atlantis."
Amber Heard,"Not knowing what they are, Mera seems to enjoy eating roses."
