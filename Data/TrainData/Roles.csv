Ben Kingsley,"Originally born in captivity in the menagerie of the Rajah of Oodeypore, India, Bagheera began to pine for his freedom after he ran away with his friends. Once he was mature and strong enough he broke the lock on his cage and escaped into the jungle, where his ferocity and cunning won him the respect of all its other inhabitants, except Shere Khan the tiger (likely out of his arrogance). Bagheera revealed all this to Mowgli later. None but Mowgli ever learned that Bagheera once wore a collar and chain, explaining the cat's special insight concerning Men."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is presented as a wise figure. Level-headed and intelligent, the panther is amongst the most down-to-earth residents of the jungle. When first introduced, he is seen as a selfless and caring individual, rescuing the orphaned Mowgli, and going out of his way to ensure his safety from that moment forward. Although he cares a great deal about the man-cub, Bagheera is also easily frustrated and intolerable of tomfoolery. This would result in rather heated arguments against the two, specifically in regards to whether or not Mowgli should remain in the jungle or return to the Man Village to live amongst his own species. Bagheera's temper can occasionally blind his sense of judgment, resulting in careless behavior such as abandoning Mowgli in the jungle despite the knowing dangers that lurk. Nevertheless, he is quick to reform and repeatedly finds himself by Mowgli's side once again. He is a devoted ally and makes it a crucial objective to protect those he cares about."
Ben Kingsley,"Bagheera is also commonly known as the foil of Baloo the bear, whom the former views as a ""stupid, jungle bum"". The two have opposite personalities, and continuously annoy one another with their need to push their own personal opinions onto each other. Nevertheless, these conflicts mostly centered around Mowgli's fate, and the two generally share a brotherly bond. Following the climax, when it appeared Baloo had met his demise, Bagheera revealed that he truly did care for the bear, and was notably embarrassed to see that Baloo had overheard his heartfelt eulogy. Once Mowgli made the decision to return to the Man Village, Bagheera and Baloo joyfully returned to their lives in the jungle, setting aside their differences and remained together as best friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Prior to his accident, Strange had a massive ego and pride that fueled his career. As a result, Strange only took on patients that he believed would help benefit his status, even refusing to heal a U.S. Army Colonel's back, albeit it was because this injury was a simple one any neurosurgeon can fix. His work was also driven by a desire to control death and time, which led him to refuse even looking into any patient he perceived to have little chance of recovery to avoid ruining his track record. However, if he also perceived the chance a patient could survive, he would help them recover even if it would not benefit his public image, showing that at his core, he does care about saving people. In addition, he seemed to prioritize his research over his physician work, as he stated his work would save thousands for years to come, whereas a physician would only save a handful of patients that they'd have to directly interact with. This, however, changed after his accident, which left Strange a broken man and constantly frustrated due to being incapable of returning to the life he knew. Upon visiting Kamar-Taj, Strange initially maintained his narrow-minded arrogance and stubbornly refused to believe that the Ancient One was telling the truth until she forcibly demonstrated astral projection and sent him across multiple dimensions to prove her point."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange has shown extreme determination and stubbornness, a useful trait in a doctor as he would never give up on his patients, even when one was called dead with a bullet in his brain. Also, Strange was able to determine the patient was still alive to successfully save him. He spent most of his remaining money in seven different surgeries to attempt to heal his hands to the point of near bankruptcy, remained outside of Kamar-Taj's front door for five hours after being initially thrown out, then spent most of his time at Kamar-Taj studying and improving his abilities, even going as far as studying while sleeping through astral projection. He even allowed himself to be violently killed by countless times by Dormammu until he gave in to his demands and later giving up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for saving Tony Stark's life when he was about to be killed by the Mad Titan, even though wanted to save the Time Stone first. Despite his determined and stubborn attitude, Strange has shown to be the voices of reason to those around him."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his training with the Ancient One, Strange gained a newfound appreciation for the natural order of things due to his studies of the Mystic Arts and became more humble. However, this was not to say he was a completely changed man; he retained a cocky attitude when dealing with people and things, as seen in how he behaved when he went to borrow books from Wong. This, coupled with his inquisitiveness and willingness to break rules, made him an odd one in Kamar-Taj and constantly an annoyance to many of his peers. However, due to this nature of his, he was also more willing to compromise and be somewhat flexible with his principles, quickly accepting that the Ancient One broke her own rules to do what was deemed necessary to protect the world, and he had to be willing to do so himself, which, when combined with his natural talent in the Mystic Arts, had the Ancient One name him as the new Master of the New York Sanctum, despite his relative lack of training and inexperience."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Having trained as a doctor, Strange is a pacifist as he tries to avoid in killing and physically harming people, as it goes against the Hippocratic oath. He was disgusted by his actions in killing Lucian Aster, stating he became a doctor to save lives, not take them. However, neither the Ancient One nor Karl Mordo was especially sympathetic towards this, with the former stating it was his towering ego and delusion that he could control death itself that made him become a doctor and the latter simply calling him a coward for not having the spine to do what has to be done. Nevertheless, Strange claimed that there were other ways to defeat their enemies, a claim he ultimately proved correct by defeating Dormammu without killing him. However, overtime, Strange has come to terms that he would have to forsaken his pacifist in killing and physically harming people in order to do what's right, but it mostly shows that he did grow a spine in order to do what needed to be done. Strange even goes to the point of not caring what happens to anyone that has mental and physical issues, as shown when he was going to allow a group of villains from different universes with their own Spider-Men to return to their universes and meet their fates instead of helping them, which goes against his nature as a doctor, although his intentions were to preserve the safety of the Multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Despite coming off as arrogant and genuinely selfish, Strange does have good intentions and is open-minded. Also, Strange shows loyalty to those he considers his allies or friends and would help them in anyway he could. Strange has even shown an emotional side, especially when it comes to those who are closes to him, as he nearly broke down after the Ancient One's death, saying goodbye to Christine Palmer, the prospect of losing his memory of Peter Parker, seeing the memory of Palmer giving him his watch and having to recall his sister's death. In addition, Strange would show a soft spot for orphaned children or teenagers, as he showed this to Spider-Man and America Chavez. However, Strange's greatest strength is his flexibility, as shown when he used the time stone to give himself and Mordo a second chance in stopping the Hong Kong Sanctum from getting destroyed by Kaecilius and letting Dormammu into their universe. Strange also willing help Thor locate Odin so he and Loki would return to Asgard, in spite of his mistrust."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"During his talk with Kaecilius, Strange began to see his own failings reflected in him and started showing signs of self-improvement, as shown when he expressed a newfound trust in Nicodemus West. Also, during his talk with the Ancient One before her death, he admitted that his fear of failure is what pushed him to be a successful neurosurgeon. In addition, Strange has confessed to his alternate self and later to another universe Christine Palmer, that the reason why he often comes off as aloof and arrogant, as well as controlling and sometimes paranoid is due to his childhood trauma of having to watch his younger sister drown because he was unable to do anything to save her. The sense of helplessness that he felt that day has developed into a need to always keep everything under control, due to his own fear of ever having to go through such trauma again. Strange also developed a fear of losing those who are closes to him. In addition, Strange seems to have a severe case of misophonia, meaning he is greatly distracted by even the slightest sound when he requires absolute focus. This was shown when he was operating on a patient and asked West to cover his watch as the ticking was distracting him, this even extended to his performing of spells, as Spider-Man's constant chattering in an attempt to make alterations to his spell distracted him and made him lose control of it and break open the multiverse."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Through his fear of losing those who are closes to him, Strange tries not to hurt or damage the lives of those around him, as shown when he was reluctant to tell his friends and fellow superheroes, especially Stark, the outcome against Thanos as he hoped for another way to defeat him until he realized that there wasn't and had no choice but to make sure the only victory against the mad titan would happen and how he hesitated and got emotional in going through with the spell that would make himself and the world forget Peter Parker. However, Strange has been secretly blaming himself for sacrificing Stark's life as he felt responsible for how the lives of his friends and allies got damaged because of his actions, even though his efforts saved the universe. This was shown when Strange felt at fault for Parker's identity as Spider-Man getting exposed by one of his enemies and ruining his life, which contributed to his decision to help the boy. Strange also showed remorse and sympathized with Wanda Maximoff as he feels guilty, because he gave Thanos the Time Stone, that she had to kill someone she loved to stop the mad titan, but it turned out to be for nothing, created a hex in a town, got corrupted by the Darkhold and became the Scarlet Witch. However, Strange's guilt was mostly because he had come to see Stark and Parker as his friends."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Although he has a good heart, Strange has shown to get easily annoyed and frustrated with everyone around him, especially his friends and allies, as he can be harsh and would lose his temper with them at times. Also, Strange has let his pride get the better of him, as he would place the blame on others instead of taking responsibility for his actions and mistakes. This is shown when Strange blamed Palmer, West and other doctors for ruining his life because he wouldn't accept the fact that the car accident was caused by his carelessness and lack of regard for his safety, and Parker for botching up the spells that was meant to help restore his secret identity as Spider-Man, even though they were both to blame for the incident. Also, Strange can sound heartless whenever he was upset and doesn't listen to reason, even when his friends or allies call him out for his behavior, as seen when he wasn't fazed when Parker told him to have a heart. However, despite his annoyances, frustration and pride, Strange does understand that those around him had good intentions and their hearts were in the right place. Also, Strange would make an honest effort in making amends for his actions and mistakes, especially if he realized how badly he messed up, hurt and pushed those he cares about away."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After taking his talk with the Ancient One to the heart, Strange showed strong selflessness, as seen during his battle with Dormammu, allowing himself to be killed over and over in order to keep Dormammu trapped in the time loop so mankind could live and let go of his fear of failure. Also, through the alternate Palmer's encouragement, Strange decided to put his other fears behind him, although he would always have his fear of losing those who are closes to him. However, despite demonstrating tremendous maturity, Strange does maintains some of his old habits such as making sarcastic comments and jokes when talking to others, similar to Iron Man and Peter Quill. He also retains his meticulous and diligence by forming a watchlist of individuals that might pose a threat to Earth, such as Loki."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Strange's imagination and intellect have given him a vastly flexible personality, so much so the Ancient One could never see exactly what his future would be, only possible paths he would take. Due to his inquisitiveness, Strange is easily able to adapt and teach himself light years ahead of even experienced sorcerers like Mordo and Kaecilius. Once he started to get the hang of his sorcery studies, he began to teach himself and was able to learn at an accelerated rate. Also, through his intelligence, Strange is able to imagine unorthodox solutions to problems, even when he lacked experience of using powerful magical relics. After his car crash, Strange's hands suffered from constant shaking, but it faded overtime, due to his training as a sorcerer. Strange even refused to direct magic into his body to heal his hands like Jonathan Pangborn did with his legs, presumably to be reminded of his mistakes in the past that led him to leave his old life as a neurosurgeon behind and the beginning of his new one as a sorcerer/superhero."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"Shere Khan is known throughout the entire jungle as a tiger without mercy as well as being ruthless, sadistic, psychopathic, arrogant, hateful, power-hungry, and hypocritical, who mainly kills for his own pleasure instead of survival. His most defining personality trait is his unbounded hatred towards mankind, possibly due to a previous encounter with them, and was willing to break the law of the jungle to satisfy his thirst for their blood. He always makes grand gestures about the ever-changing nature of the jungle, ranting to Akela how he allowed the man to live among the inhabitants. However, he was also incapable to think that perhaps he was also one of the reasons that the humans are cruel towards their environment."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"ike his previous versions, The Grinch started out as a cranky, grumpy, solitary, and selfish creature who likes to bully and antagonize the citizens of Whoville whenever he can. He takes some sadistic pride in his work, sees an artistry and style to being generally mean and nasty."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"However, deep down, he has a soft spot as he shows to his dog Max and a select few individuals that manage to appeal to it under his rough exterior."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"After learning the true meaning of Christmas, he redeemed himself and realize that he wasn't alone anymore, because of Cindy Lou's kindness."
Chris Evans,"Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Rogers has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original values and character. Since his reawakening, Rogers was saddened by losing so much of his time, but still retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. He was also very empathetic; being able to understand and relate to both Wamda and Pietro Maximoff before meeting them and understanding Tony Stark's motivation during the Avengers Civil War, despite Iron Man being on the opposing side. He also conceded that Stark had very good reasons not to join the Time Heist and openly said he was happy that his friend had finally found the peace that he'd so desperately wanted."
Chris Evans,"What separates Steve Rogers from the other Avengers is two things: his humanity and morality. Steve Rogers is an extremely dedicated person. Despite originally being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of service to his country in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the war effort by starring in propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Barnes, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Rogers disobeyed his superior's orders and went behind enemy lines in an apparent suicide mission and rescued them. Rogers finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, and does not hesitate to stand up to corrupt politicians, hypocritical authority figures, powerful beings like Loki, or even the nearly omnipotent Thanos. His determination also aids him, giving him a boost in physical power to allow him to hold off beings of much greater strength, with this even allowing him to survive against Thanos. A true hero, Rogers is more than willing to sacrifice himself to protect others and does not care if he is considered the villain in his heroic job, as his desire to protect the innocent remained as strong as ever, even after he was deemed a criminal. Though he refused to give up in the immediate aftermath of the Snap, following the disastrous Ambush on Thanos, even Rogers conceded defeat. When Scott Lang returned however, Rogers quickly got his fighting spirit back, being the first to support Scott's plan. The true extent of his determination and selfless heroism was fully exemplified when he finally proved himself worthy to wield Mj��lnir. Amusingly however, when facing off with his past self, Rogers actually seemed annoyed by his own sheer determina"
Chris Evans,"Captain America's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness often puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a grey morality to protect people. This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. This difference in attitude, reached a head in the Avengers Civil War, where Tony sought to compromise with governments who were increasingly intolerant with collateral damage, while Rogers refused to do so, believing it would inhibit the Avengers' response time, eventually causing him to become a fugitive. Rogers nevertheless still cared for Tony and did not desire for them to fight, as he pleaded with Tony to stop attacking Bucky, as the latter did it without having control and did not kill him after beating him, even going as far as to send him a letter to apologize and a phone so Stark can contact him. He was visibly ashamed when Tony demanded him to tell the truth of his parents' death, and felt enough sympathy and remorse for keeping the truth hidden that he relinquished his shield and returned it to the Stark family. Two years later, after much of the anger between the two factions of Avengers had died down, Rogers outright referred to Iron Man as Earth's ""best defender,"" even joking that he himself was a poor substitute emphasizing the respect he maintained for Tony."
Chris Evans,"While Captain America's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought to be a dead best friend, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship. This reached its apex in the Avengers Civil War, where Steve steadfastly refused to give up on Bucky, which caused the Avengers to fracture along with more than half their number to become fugitives."
Chris Evans,"Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone, or greatly aged. Even while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new complicated world. Although he eventually reunited with both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a ""man out of time."" However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of the second incarnation of the Avengers."
Chris Evans,"He is very protective of his friends from his past, especially Bucky Barnes, and is willing to go to great lengths to save them, being susceptible to emotional and violent acts to fulfill his goal. He seems to have developed a trust and attraction towards Sharon Carter. During his time with the new team of Avengers, he developed a trust and bond with Black Widow. He also embraces links to his own time, often seeing much of Howard Stark in Tony. He is also very selfless and is willing to risk his life for his teammates, such as when he jumped in to save Black Widow from Proxima Midnight, without knowing he would be strong enough to hold back her spear."
Chris Evans,"He does have a darker side, however, with Ultron noting that Rogers had been a soldier for so long, he subconsciously craved conflict and battles to avoid a civilian life and being forced to confront all he lost. Indeed, his worst nightmare, caused by Maximoff. Maximoff, was shown to be the end of the war, with people not needing him anymore, leaving him with one hollow realization: everyone whom he had ever loved was gone, and he was alone. Overall, Rogers is a selfless person but one with a notable blind spot: his childhood friend Bucky Barnes. The last living link to his time, Rogers was willing to do everything to protect him, going so far as to abandon his role as leader of the Avengers and a team player. When Tony called Rogers out on failing the role of Captain America, at the end of their fight during the Avengers Civil War, Rogers abandoned his shield and with it, the identity of ""Captain America,"" heeding Tony's point. Even years later, he had made no efforts to reclaim the moniker allowing his uniform to darken and removing the American stars that had once adorned it."
Chris Evans,"Rogers has a strong dislike for agencies or groups that express control over the individual, due to having fought vigorously for his nations' freedom and losing the world he knew for that very reason. This dislike extends to groups of any ideology be they HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., or even America's own government. Rogers himself admits that the Howling Commandos committed less than moral actions during World War II, but it was for the basis that people could be free, whereas Project Insight was using fear to dissuade a national security risk before it happens, eliminating the need for a soldier like himself and taking away the American people's freedom. The desire for free will heavily influenced Rogers' opinion on the Sokovia Accords. He strongly believed that the extravagant politics involved would restrict (or at least hinder) the Avengers' efforts to protect innocent people, putting him at odds with the very pragmatic Tony Stark on the issue. His opinion on such groups lessened, when the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre locked up Barnes in a cage. In the end, such was his dislike that he cut all ties with them and became a fugitive after the Avengers Civil War. While he still retains his desire to protect the innocent, he has no desire to be re-acknowledged as a superhero and does not care about the opinions of government bodies, as he coldly told Thaddeus Ross that he did not care if the latter disapproves of him and even went as far as to say he would not hesitate to fight him if he got in his way."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy is fiercely optimistic and independent. Since childhood, she had harbored a dream to become a police officer, to make the world a better place. She cares for the well-being of others, and is always willing to extend a helping hand."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Due to being a rabbit, a species not known for being police officers, Judy faced continuous doubt from those around her, from her parents to local bullies. Nevertheless, she used this doubt as a means to increase her determination; she believed in the importance of always trying and making an effort to reach her goals, one of which was to eventually become a police officer of Zootopia, a city where predator and prey supposedly live together in peace and harmony, believing she will be quickly accepted amongst her peers. Unfortunately, she was too idealistic in this regard and found herself unprepared when facing the reality that city had both positive and negative aspects including prejudice, stereotyping, and profiling."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Unfortunately, Judy's fierce determination, at times, causes her to be overconfident and impulsive. She is shown to leap into action without always taking the time to fully think things through. This leads her to: abandon her post on parking duty to pursue Duke Weaselton into Little Rodentia causing considerable mayhem; almost get herself fired by taking on the Otterton case without permission; stake her career on being able to solve that case in 48 hours before learning that she has no resources; threaten to expose Mr. Big to his face which leads to him deciding to ice her and Nick; steal an entire train car full of evidence, rather than simply taking some key evidence to the ZPD. This leads to them nearly crashing into another train and ultimately destroying almost all the evidence."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Despite the odds, Judy remains optimistic and determined, adapting herself to the environment of Zootopia and those around her to build up both the way she presents herself and pursue her goals. She is clever, kind, and resourceful, which proves to be her greatest asset. She tarnishes the stereotype of a ""dumb bunny"", being intelligent enough to outsmart professional con artist, Nick Wilde, several times. Months of training at the Zootopia Police Academy has also left her tactical, with an impressive amount of physical prowess. During times of chaos, she can quickly take charge of a situation by concocting an efficient plan on the spot, being daring enough to take dangerous chances, in order to potentially end the day victorious. More often than not, Judy comes out successful as a result of this."
Ginnifer Goodwin,"Judy believes that predators and prey should be treated equally and works to follow that belief. However, due to her childhood experience, having been bullied, attacked and injured by a fox, Judy harbors a degree of unconscious fear of predators (mainly foxes), such that while she is aware that predators don't pose a threat, there is a small part of her that does believe they could revert to their primitive savage ways."
Jack Black,"Po is usually easygoing, playful, and cocky like a big kid, as well as rather ""fanboyish"" when expressing his love for kung fu. In the first film, he is seen as a huge kung fu fan, owning posters and action figures of his favorite warriors, but is himself clumsy, portly, and having low self-confidence, only dreaming he could be a great warrior while feeling stuck in his unfulfilling life at his father's noodle shop. But when given the chance, he is all too eager to learn kung fu the hard way, enduring physical beatings and insults in hopes of changing who he is. After learning that ""there is no secret ingredient"", Po shows the inner strength to save the Valley of Peace by using his own skills and ingenuity and in the end becomes his own hero."
Jack Black,"Po possesses a kind and selfless nature, and is generally friendly and laid back. He also has a strong sense of justice, and is willing to risk his life to protect others. Though immature and oblivious in some situations, Po is able to take things seriously when it is called for, and is not hesitant to accept heavy responsibility���at times taking on more than he can handle. He is also capable of learning things very quickly with the right motivation, as shown in the first film, and has memorized a vast amount of knowledge about kung fu, even being reliable enough to teach a class on "
Jack Black,"Po also displays an action-craving attitude along with a natural affinity for humor, and isn't above acting clownish and dishing out quips, even making fun of himself, in order to entertain others. Imaginative and adventurous, he continues to act excitable and marvel over his heroes even after he has become the Dragon Warrior, at times leaving them embarrassed by his behavior. As Po tends to be less serious and disciplined than other masters, he also tends to think more outside the box, and will find different, creative ways to solve a problem if need be. Po has also broken some rules and traditions (as well as still having a habit of breaking physical things), though this is often unintentional. Po's lack of discipline and flippant personality often give him an unintentional advantage over his enemies, since, combined with his appearance, it causes them to disregard him or struggle to take him seriously, so they are often shocked when he proves to be a tenacious and incredibly skilled warrior."
Jack Black,"One of the recurring plot lines in the television series is Po's struggle to not let his title affect his ego. Throughout the series, he is shown to have many adoring fans and he welcomes the attention, occasionally to the point that it begins to negatively impact his duties or those around him. Despite this, he also possesses the self-awareness to realize when he has made a mistake, and is willing to accept responsibility for his actions."
Jack Black,"Though having grown more confident since becoming the Dragon Warrior, Po nevertheless has moments of intimidation and self-doubt. Even as he tries to talk tough, this boisterous behavior tends to become more comical than threatening, and is perhaps a front for the panda's insecurities. Despite this, Po does have a sense of dignity and defiance, as shown in the first film when he argued with Master Shifu as he tried to leave the palace, and in the second film when he argued with Tigress in order to seek out Shen."
Jack Black,"In the third film, as Po is continuously pushed to his limits, first by Shifu making him the Master of the Furious Five and then the arrival of Kai and subsequent defeat of most of his friends, as well as having found his biological father and having to please both him and Ping, Po finally starts to reveal how for all his light-heartedness and optimism, he is not without limits. While confident in his fighting ability, Po is forced to reflect inwardly and rely on his mind and spirit in order to fully understand himself and, therefore, master Chi. He approached the challenge enthusiastically and diligently, but displayed anger, frustration, and doubt when Li admitted to lying. Po was quick to forgive his father, and, quickly adapts to his circumstances to defeat Kai."
Jack Black,"Po has not only matured since his days before learning kung fu, but his unlikely triumph as the Dragon Warrior has changed those around him. Simple, good-natured, and fueled by determination, Po has never held grudges, not even against those who doubt him or treat him with contempt, and is selfless when it comes to protecting those in need, even being able to show compassion for his enemies. Po is much like the opposite of the foes he faces, such as Tai Lung, Shen, and Kai, in that he shows light-heartedness and humility instead of arrogance and desire for more power. It is these qualities, as well as his great respect for kung fu and his loving heart, that mark Po as the Dragon Warrior, able to defeat such villains when no one else could."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is an exceptional and intelligent scientist on par with Hank Pym enough for the latter to consider him his rival. He, however, resented Pym for his ego and attempt to fire him. From this point on, he develops a fierce hatred for Pym, deriding his egotistical nature and arrogance. Beyond this resentment for Pym, however, he's rather kind and affectionate, getting along quite well with Scott Lang upon meeting him and commenting on his size-increasing trials in the old days."
Laurence Fishburne,"It is later revealed that Foster deeply cares for Ava Starr, doing whatever he could to heal her of her condition. This love is so deep that he treats Starr like his own daughter, tolerating several of her more ruthless actions, and refused to leave her side, even when his life was at risk. Despite his love for her, Foster's tolerance for her actions has a limit; this is particularly seen when Starr suggested kidnapping Lang's daughter. Foster vehemently rejected the idea, going so far as to say if she laid one finger on her, he would no longer help her. Despite Starr's attempt to push him away, Foster could not turn his back to her and decided to go off the grid with her."
Laurence Fishburne,"Foster is shown to be a loyal and devoted friend, as it was his friendship with Elihas Starr that drove him to try to help Ava in the first place and having been good friends with Janet van Dyne, her and Elihas's fates being among the prominent reasons why he resented Hank, with Foster indicating that he had tried to persuade Janet to avoid being with Hank and regretting his failure that caused her seeming death, Foster, despite at first dismissing the potential that Janet would be ripped apart if he extracted her quantum energy, eventually came to hesitate doing so out of concern of what would happen to his former colleague at the last moment, worrying that Pym may have been correct about van Dyne being ripped apart by the process, and urged Starr to find another way. Even with all that had happened between him and Hank, Foster never wanted him dead, as he did not allow Ava to kill Hank in her search for more quantum energies and was concerned when Hank feigned a heart attack. They eventually achieved a reconciliation of sorts, as Foster came to trust that Hank would help in Ava's recovery after he had saved Janet."
Marion Cotillard,"An idealist, Sofia believes she can better the world through her work at Abstergo[4] and seeks to eradicate humanity's violent impulses using science and the Pieces of Eden. In doing so, she hopes to create a more peaceful society."
Marion Cotillard,"A hard working scientist above all, she could be quite distant at times and often disregarded giving credit to others, such as taking credit for the Animus 4.3 concept art conceived by Layla Hassan."
Marion Cotillard,"Her relationship with her father Alan Rikkin was difficult and estranged most of the time; where he sought to contain the Assassin threat, she only sought to contain violence itself."
Michael Fassbender,"Affected by the death of his mother, Callum grew up with a disdain for violence against women. On one occasion he killed a pimp, although such an action would lead to his eventual arrest and death sentence. Callum also initially had no interest in the Assassins' fight and opposed them out of spite for his father."
Michael Fassbender,"After several sessions in the Animus 4.3, Callum developed the Bleeding Effect and saw his ancestor Aguilar as a hallucinatory phantom. When Callum violently desycnhronized from an Animus session, he was left temporarily paralyzed from the waist down."
Michael Fassbender,"Callum's opinion about his father and later, Assassins, changed after he confronted Joseph about Mary's death in which the latter explained that he did what he had to do to prevent the Templars from claiming Aguilar's Apple of Eden (though it was Mary who forced his hand due to his moment of weakness, the same reason he couldn't kill his son). Initially siding with Templars in the search for the Apple of Eden in question, Callum soon understood what Joseph truly felt at the time when relieving the moment his ancestor Aguilar was forced to watch Maria dying during the Templars' betrayal. This, coupled with meeting phantoms of his parents along with those of his parents who inducted him into the Assassins, he eventually embraced his lineage and continued his parents and fellow Assassins' battle against Templars."
Michael Fassbender,"Erik has lived a troubled life, having felt mankind's cruelty not only as a mutant but also as a Jewish person. Erik was forced to watch as his people suffered under the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.[2] He is filled with hatred and anger mainly against Sebastian Shaw, who murdered his mother before his very eyes and forced Erik to experience horrendous tortures."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is absolutely devoted to the cause of protecting mutant kind, refusing to let mutants suffer a similar holocaust. Erik will protect his species at any cost, no matter how many human lives must be sacrificed.[2] His devotion to the cause and the fact that what he says about mankind is often true, many mutants have joined him over the years. He will even sacrifice his fellow mutants, if it will serve the cause, such as the pawns of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Mystique,[3] once he found out about the Sentinels.[4] However, despite his devotion, he refused to put his life on the line unless he had no other choice and was more than willing to sacrifice mutants if it would keep him out of harm's way, forcing Rogue to take his place in a machine that would kill its user and letting the ""pawns"" in his Brotherhood attack Alcatraz first, the former of which Wolverine called him out on saying if he was really righteous he would carry out his plan himself instead of endangering the life of a young girl."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto firmly believes that humans and mutants are not capable of co-existing, and believes mutants to be superior and the next stage in evolution. This conflicts greatly with the beliefs of Professor X, to whom Magneto frequently argues that if action isn't taken to ensure mutants' survival then a holocaust similar to that which he lived through will happen (a fate which indeed came to pass by 2023). He is not, however, above working with the X-Men when the situation calls for it despite the X-Men fighting to protect his enemies in addition to mutants, and when at death's doorstep in 2023 admits that he regrets all the years that he and Charles spent fighting each other despite their difference in goals."
Michael Fassbender,"Magneto is completely accepting of any and all mutants, regardless of their abilities who they are, what they have done, and their past with him (with the exception of Sebastian Shaw, who started Erik on his dark path by murdering Erik's mother in front of him and then experimenting on him).[1] Erik loves the mutant kind and will never turn away a mutant who wishes to fight for mutant freedom alongside him. In spite of this, Magneto does not seem to truly hate humanity on a fundamental level; he has had relationships with at least two human women, Ms. Maximoff[4] (which, unknown to him, led to the birth of his son Quicksilver) and his wife, Magda, whom he loved dearly.[5] Rather, Magneto hates and fears what humanity can (and in the original timeline, does) do to mutant kind, having survived the holocaust, and he does not wish to see that happen again to his fellow mutants. He is fully aware how cruel humans can be and sees that mutants can be paralleled to the Jewish population under Nazi rule. However, he does view mutants and humans as two very distinct species and does not believe that coexistence is possible.[2][1] He has, however, attempted this as of the revised timeline, which leads to his family being killed, which may have further cemented this belief. He believed Charles is naive and foolish for believing humanity will not always oppress and segregate mutants.[5] It can be argued that Magneto's hatred towards humans can be all in defense of mutant kind."
Michael Fassbender,"Along with standard police training, Hole undertakes specialized training in interrogation techniques and firearms at the FBI. His problematic and often unsocial behavior, as well as his obsessive tendencies during investigations, brings him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues. Bjarne M��ller, head of the Oslo Police Department, often shields Hole from being fired, believing he is a brilliant detective and vital to certain investigations. This repeated protection results in Harry feeling loyal and close to M��ller. Other in the police department whom he comes to trust include as friends Beate L��nn and Bj��rn Holm (both in the forensics division), Katrine Bratt (a Bergen detective who helps secure specialist information), and Gunnar Hagen (Harry's former senior officer prior to Phantom). Hole's skills become renowned enough that he is considered a specialist, leading him to be sought for occasional consultation by authorities in other cities and countries. In the firs travels to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police (who refer to him as ""Harry Holy"").[1] In the second novel, Cockroaches, he is called to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador."
Michael Fassbender,"Outside of the department, Hole develops a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke. Her son from a previous relationship, Oleg, comes to view Harry as a father figure, sometimes calling him ""dad."" After the seventh novel The Snowman, Harry's relationship with Rakel suffers. This, along with recent trauma, compels Hole to leave Oslo and the police force. The next novel The Leopard shows Harry living in self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Kaja Solness, a new Norwegian Crime Squad officer, asks him to return to Oslo to help investigate a possible serial killing. Learning his father Olav is also ill and likely to soon die, Hole agrees to help and returns to Oslo. During the story, Olav asks his son to assist in his suicide in order to end his pain, but Harry cannot bring himself to do so. At the end of the book, Harry has a brief reunion with Rakel before then visiting the imprisoned killer of The Snowman. It is implied that Harry then aids in the criminal's own suicide. Disturbed by his recent experiences, Harry determines to return to Hong Kong for good."
Ryan Reynolds,"Wade is a man with a deeply perverted, deranged and sometimes dark sense of humor. Probably Wade's most defining characteristics is his non stop motor mouth no matter the situation and his love of pop cultures from all periods of time such as referencing Mama June or having an Adventure Time wristwatch. As a mercenary Wade is usually only in for anything for money. He is pansexual, who will flirt outrageously with pretty much anyone."
Ryan Reynolds,"Despite this, as Weasel pointed out Wade does have some moral compass as shown when he had most of the money he took from helping a teenage girl with her stalker sent back to her and as pointed let the kid who was stalking her off with a simple while very threatening warning. Another of Wade's redeemable features is his love for his girlfriend Vanessa as he was shown to do anything even considering joining the X-Men to get the help of two of their members Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to rescue her. Wade also displays some heroic traits as shown when he tackles Negasonic Teenage Warhead out of the way of gunfire and going to great lengths to prevent mutant time traveler and soldier Cable from murdering teenager Russell Collins even if it was for the good of the future."
Ryan Reynolds,"Harry's relationship with his son is shown as being strained due to his work, where Tim was raised by his maternal grandmother rather than by him or his wife. However, Harry clearly makes an effort to reach out to Tim and cares for his son very much regardless, to the point where he was willing to set up a room for him to stay in and keep it clean for years just in case his son decided he wanted to live with him."
Will Smith,"Deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional: as long as he's been paid to kill someone, he will always carry it out without mercy, except women and children. He is also sarcastic and have a personal method where he has to be paid first to get his job done and will threaten his employers furthermore when he is offended, evidenced by wanting double the original payment for his job because his ""client"" was being a ""dickhead;"" alongside his sarcasm, he has an incredibly tough attitude, and can work even under the highest of pressure."
Will Smith,"Despite his sarcastic, tough attitude, Floyd notably strikes up a friendship with Harley Quinn quite quickly, empathizes with El Diablo after learning the latter's dark secret, is greatly respected by his teammates, and has influence over them (with Rick Flag himself pointing this out), and finally he cares deeply for his beloved daughter Zoe, keeping a picture of her with him throughout his time as an assassin and inmate. He also holds a strict code about not killing women and children in his line of work, thus proving himself to have a strict moral compass. Notably, when Amanda Waller attempts to psychologically manipulate Deadshot by promising him the freedom and a permanent reunion with Zoe in exchange for assassinating Harley Quinn, he is strongly tempted for a few long moments. Ultimately, however, with quite a bit of visible effort, Deadshot realizes his unwillingness to betray his moral code of not murdering women, as well as his friendship with Harley (most likely also due to him realizing that Zoe wouldn't have ever approved of the circumstances of such a permanent reunion if she knew), and so he resists, instead pretending to miss while shooting at Harley (though Deadshot may be willing to make exceptions, to his moral code in some situations, as he plotted with Harley to kill Rick Flag and Katana and contributed to Enchantress' defeat)."
Will Smith,"Also, while not outspoken about it, Deadshot appears to be at least somewhat religious, wearing a cross while in civilian apparel and having several biblical verses written on the gauntlets and neck of his combat bodysuit."
Will Smith,"Genie is full of life and bursting with positive energy. Though he is amongst the most powerful, chaotic beings in the universe, Genie is benevolent, easygoing, and friendly; so much so that he primarily uses his abilities as a means to amuse both himself and those around him. According to the filmmakers' commentary, Genie's energy is a direct result of his imprisonment; his years of isolation have left him teaming with vigor, so whenever he is given a chance at freedom, his first instinct is to go wild with his powers by cracking jokes and entertaining whatever audience he has. He is also inviting, as when he first met Aladdin, Genie immediately introduced himself as a friend to rely on and emphasized the fact that his purpose was to magically enhance Aladdin's life by any means necessary (so long as it did not interfere with the three rules of wishing)."
Will Smith,"Though he was generally devoted to whoever held temporary ownership of the lamp, Genie has always had a will and mind of his own, outside the bounds of a stereotypical genie slave. As seen during his time as Jafar's lackey, Genie's job did not require him to agree with his masters' morals. It did, however, force him to adhere to their three commands without question, no matter how vile they may have been. Nevertheless, he was still able to provide advice to masters that were willing to listen. In the first film, he served as a mentor figure to Aladdin, often giving the latter advice and encouragement when needed, as seen when he urged Aladdin to tell Jasmine the truth about not being a prince. As mentioned, Genie did not offer himself as a mere slave, but rather as a supportive friend to his masters. His friendship with Aladdin proved that he was capable of forming genuine relationships with masters, though it was not until Aladdin that Genie was treated as anything beyond a mere slave by his superiors. This tied to Genie's dream of being freed from the lamp."
Will Smith,"Though mischievous, manic, and explosive, Genie is also compassionate, wise, and serious when he feels it's necessary. He understands human emotions to a profound degree and takes matters such as love, trust, and being true to yourself quite seriously. His more sincere moments are indicated by his tone, which changes from wily and exuberant, to low and soft when he wants to get a serious point across. Despite this, he still tries to lighten even the darkest moments with a dose of comedy, an example of this being the climax of the original film, where Genie transformed into a cheerleading squad to root for Aladdin during his battle against Jafar."
Will Smith,"Junior was created from the DNA of Henry Brogan, a Defense International Agency assassin, by Clayton Verris, the director of a black ops terrorist organization, to end the life of the outgoing assassin."
Will Smith,"He was dispatched to Colombia to find and kill Henry Brogan, almost getting on equal footing with him. Arriving at a safehouse, he is revealed to be Clay's adoptive ""son"". He is ordered to finish the job despite being curious on how he possesses similarities to Henry. Henry is also troubled by his similarities to the assassin, whom Danny suggests might be his child despite Henry's denials. He tells Baron to take him to Hungary. DNA testing reveals that Henry and Junior's DNA are identical, proving that Junior was a clone of Henry all along. Henry then meets Yuri, and learns of the cloning project and that the man he killed was one of the project's scientists. Having designed a method to produce clones devoid of pain or emotion, the scientist tried to leave the project and was killed upon being discovered."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his physical shortcomings, Hiccup does his best to succeed as a Viking. He is intelligent and is constantly creating inventions for various uses throughout the first film, including a bola launcher, a dragon's prosthetic tail and saddle, and a riding vest. However, he is much stronger than he appears."
Jay Baruchel,"Overall, Hiccup is an intelligent, kind, and likable person who is naturally big-hearted and innocent. After the first film, he and Toothless have become ""adrenaline junkies"", performing tricks like free-falling. He has also gone from being a shy boy to a confident young man, and ""the greatest Dragon Master this world has ever seen"" (as Astrid describes him to Drago Bludvist). He has a charitable and kind nature which allows him to see the good in everyone. He has especially shown to care deeply for Toothless, his parents, Stoick and Valka, Astrid, and later their children Zephyr and Nuffink."
Jay Baruchel,"He is very protective of Astrid and in the first movie, he has a crush on her. Their feelings mature as they grew up and as the franchise progressed. Among the other teenage Vikings, Hiccup first comes off as awkward, mainly because he's a poor fighter, and rather scrawny for a Viking, prompting mockery from his peers. As he becomes more adept at fighting dragons, however, they start paying more attention to him, and friendships start developing. Despite this, Hiccup remains shy and secretive, preferring to be alone with Toothless. He also tends to be sarcastic with a dry sense of humor that can sometimes put him at odds with the other Vikings in his tribe. It also seems that Hiccup likes to hide his fear with said sarcasm and dry humor. Due to his shyness, he had a habit of stuttering and stammering when talking to some of the other Vikings, especially Astrid, or when his father is angry at him."
Jay Baruchel,"Despite his many virtues and his clear capabilities as a leader, Hiccup is not without his flaws. He is rather prone to letting his insecurities cloud his judgment and affect his actions; in the film, his desperation for the acceptance of his tribe, and his father in particular, cause him to regularly attempt to kill dragons along with the villagers, only to end up doing more harm than good due to his clumsiness. In Dragons: Riders of Berk, his mistaken belief that Stoick still does not accept him causes him to lead the other Vikings on a potentially dangerous treasure hunt to prove himself in ""Portrait of Hiccup as a Buff Man"". His innate friendliness and tendency to give others the benefit of the doubt cause him to be a little too trusting of strangers, leaving him vulnerable to manipulation and deceit by more dishonest characters, such as Heather and Mildew, on more than one occasion."
Jay Baruchel,"One extremely notable character trait Hiccup possesses is a deep sense of compassion. As a child, he is seen empathizing with his father over the loss of his mother, and even crying at the thought of an injured bird being killed in order to put it out of its misery. He later spares Toothless, and in doing so, changes the world of Vikings and dragons forever. He was extremely uncomfortable with the thought of having to kill a dragon in the arena in the first film. Hiccup carries this quality into the television series. He shows great sympathy to Snotlout at the end of the Thawfest Games, giving up his own glory and fame for the sake of his friend, though Snotlout showed no gratitude at all. He will almost never allow Toothless to use his full power against foes to prevent killing them. In ""What Flies Beneath"", he begs Toothless to spare a Whispering Death that had nearly killed both of them just moments earlier. The peak of Hiccup's sympathy is displayed in his releasing Mildew from an Outcast cell. Upon seeing the Outcasts take Mildew's one beloved possession, his sheep, Hiccup clearly displays pity for the old man. Unfortunately, Hiccup is occasionally naive in his sympathy, as Mildew betrayed him yet again right afterward. Still, his kind heartedness has resulted in many victories and accomplished the training of the deadliest dragons in the world."
John Dimaggio,"Harvey Bullock was the police chief of Gotham City and was also known as ""Bulldog"". Under Commissioner James Gordon, the city had to deal with the murders of women committed by Jack the Ripper. During the inauguration of the Gotham World Fair, Sister Leslie and Selina Kyle complained to Mayor Tolliver about the murders, but Bulldog blamed her shelters being responsible for attracting loose women. When Bruce Wayne showed up, he tried escorting the disrupting ladies out, only to be interrupted by Bruce who went to talk with Leslie and Gordon privately."
John Dimaggio,"He attended Leslie's funeral after she was murdered by the Ripper, and arrested Marlene Mahoney when she started threatening to Bruce that she would reveal he was near the scene of Leslie's murder. Later when Hugo Strange was murdered at the Arkham Asylum, Bullock and his fellow officers spotted Batman and Jack fighting atop a police blimp. As they shot toward them, they accidentally hit the blimp and caused it to crash land. Bulldog went after Batman,, assuming he was the killer, and gave his men orders to kill him on sight. Gordon however soon arrived to restrain him and stated he wanted him alive. Later when Marlene was found murdered, the police suspected Bruce and Harvey Dent told them that he should be at Selina's hotel."
John Dimaggio,"When Victor Fries was a child he made a hobby of freezing animals in order to preserve them so they can continue to exist in the future. Worried by this behavior, his parents sent him to a strict boarding school where Victor felt outcast and became depressed. However, when he met and befriended a young woman named Nora, the two fell in love and later married. But their happiness was short-lived: Nora was diagnosed with a fatal disease, and Fries, sickened with sorrow, attempted to save her using cryogenic technology. However, the experiment went terribly wrong and Fries' equipment malfunctioned, consuming him and his lab in an explosion of ice."
John Dimaggio,"Victor somehow survived, but now his body could only survive at sub-zero temperatures, and Nora's condition was now even more serious. In an effort to continue his wife's treatment, he constructed a suit which would now protect him in his altered state. Calling himself Mr. Zero, he began to rob several banks to get money. He was eventually thwarted by Batman and Robin, but struggled on. As Mr. Zero, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range."
John Dimaggio,"Although technically not insane, he is usually imprisoned in Arkham Asylum when apprehended by the Batman, as it is the only facility in Gotham that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell."
Keanu Reeves,"Due to his harsh background and being rigorously trained for his childhood and adulthood by The Director and his career in the Marines, John could be described as a very serious and stoic individual who rarely speaks more than is necessary (preferring actions over words and being described as someone who never wastes words) with a strong sense of obligation. As a professional assassin and hitman, John is highly confident in his abilities and reputation, being greatly respected and feared by many criminal organizations and other assassins alike. Despite this, he has a strong moral code as well as honor which is unique among his colleagues according to Zero as John never willingly drags innocent people to his job or threatens them during it. In spite of his professionalism, he is also friendly and develops strong friendships with many other dangerous people like Marcus and even managers of Continental Hotels, like Winston and Shimazu. His good side is also seen after meeting Helen, John was willing the end his career as a killer and live a normal happy life with her, which Winston referred to as impossible."
Keanu Reeves,"However, John is a man who is worth his reputation as The Boogeyman for his lethality as he never failed on his missions. Despite his calm and collected behavior, once he’s angered or taken by vengeance, he will stop at nothing until he kills his target no matter who or what stands in his way. After a puppy from his wife, which was the last posthumous gift from her not to be alone, was killed and his car stolen, John set out on a journey for revenge, which he’s successful but also makes other problems for himself on future eve"
Keanu Reeves,"Despite his skills, John prefers to avoid fights if he can. He is skilled at getting people to back down without resistance and will often let people go when they do and he is able to avoid allowing conflicts to escalate any further as seen when he was able to call a truce with Abram Tarasov and when he allows Zero's students to live after beating them in a fight. His friendly and professional personality allows him to maintain contacts within the assassin community who are willing to come to his aid when needed. His strong sense of honor also means he makes a point of not allowing innocent people to get caught in the crossfire of his work."
Amy Adams,"Lois is a resolute, tough, and persistent reporter, who always seeks the big scoop and story. When putting aside her job description however, Lois is shown to be kind and fair, and after her first meeting with Superman, she was so smitten with the selfless heroics, as well as the childhood pain that he had endured all his life, that she decided to drop what could have been the biggest story in modern human history for him. Superman comes to fairly quickly reciprocate her love, and after having dated her for 2 years, his love for Lois became so great, that Clark goes so far as to let her know that ""[she] is [his] world"" before confronting Doomsday in a mortal duel, making those his final words. When Superman gets resurrected with a Mother Box and suffers post-mortem amnesia, only Lois manages to save the Justice League from him, as seeing her again made Superman begin to remember his past life."
Amy Adams,"Lois also showed exceptional courage, boldly going on board the Black Zero starship with Superman when the fearsome Faora demanded it, risking her life to help foil General Zod's plan (by participating in the Phantom Drive collision counter-plan), boldly standing up to Lex Luthor with righteous anger when brought before the malevolent supergenius, risking her own life to save Superman from Batman, later risking it again to retrieve the Kryptonite spear (so that Doomsday could be stopped), and later even boldly confronting a sinister resurrected Superman (despite him having just defeated the whole Justice League in a fit of rage, as Lois correctly believed that seeing her would jump-start his memories and return his former personality)."
Amy Adams,"Lois is also quite tough, enough to be willing to kill, as she shot several Sword of Rao Kryptonians while escaping the Black Zero."
Felicity Jones,"While growing up alone from the age of fifteen, Jyn is considered reckless and undisciplined. Having little patience for debate with Alliance High Command, she prefers to take matters into her own hands."
Felicity Jones,"Even as a child, Jyn began developing a rebellious attitude but has a clear sense of right and wrong gained from her parents while growing up on Lah'mu. During her time with Saw Gerrera's insurgents, she developed a strong bond with the extremists."
Felicity Jones,"Initially, Jyn cared little about the Rebel Alliance's cause, but after watching the hologram message from her father, Galen Erso, Jyn realized how important it was that the Galactic Empire be rid from the galaxy and sacrificed herself for their cause."
Felicity Jones,"As a result of being trained by Saw Gerrera and being abandoned, develop calm yet cold demeanor, In addition, she is aggressive and distrusting, fighting off the Rebellion squad that was sent to rescue her, and keeping others at arms length until the battle at Scarif."
Felicity Jones,"Despite her aggressive and cold demeanor, Jyn is intelligent, kind, caring, selfless, has a sense of justice, honor and good morals."
Felicity Jones,"Jyn's relationship with Cassian Andor was initially complicated, as the two didn't trust one another when meeting. After learning that the immoral rebel general Davits Draven ordered him to kill Galen, she learned of his experience from the war, and the two would later become respectful allies once they disobey orders and headed to Scarif. Her relationship with K-2S0 was distasteful, with the latter having restrained her when she attacked the squad that was sent to rescue her. Despite this, K-2S0 showed himself to care for Jyn, saying he will do anything for her, and sacrificing himself for her and Cassian in his last moments."
Diego Luna,"A good Rebel agent who held dark secrets,[16] Andor was a human male standing at 1.78 meters tall[7] with brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin.[8] A man with striking good looks, Andor used his handsomeness to lure in the unsuspecting during his service as a Rebel spy."
Diego Luna,"As a Rebel, Andor was a committed, steady, practical, and by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience,[8] but that experience grew from missions that sometimes blurred the line between what was morally wrong or right. Despite his selflessness,[17] he was cold and distant to others.[16] Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary.[8] During the days of the early rebel movement, he relied on the excuse that he was following orders to justify what he had done."
Diego Luna,"Although he displayed some degree of remorse and regret after some of his actions, such as he chose to execute Tivik during the mission to the Ring of Kafrene, it was never enough to convince him to seek redemption until his adventure with Jyn Erso.[8] Nevertheless, he was more morally conflicted than fellow insurgent Saw Gerrera, who also went to great lengths to uncover intelligence on topics, particularly weapons, that threatened the Rebels.[17] In a briefing to Mothma, General Draven described Andor as ""one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,"" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion.[46] Indeed, many of the missions he carried out for the Alliance were morally questionable.[17] Mothma wondered if the command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions."
Diego Luna,"Comprising on their morals in the name of victory was dreadful for the emotional health of Rebels like Andor. In truth, Andor had been driven to the extremes he carried out by the anguish he carried inside him. Having lost everything in his life, Andor was able to hold back thinking about his morally questionable actions[17] until his time with Erso.[8] Whether it was due to killing Tivik or a change in his outlook due to the adventure he had with Erso,[17] he disobeyed orders to kill Galen Erso[8] before revealing his internal anguish by arguing with Jyn; she compared him to a stormtrooper for following orders he thought were wrong,[17] which made him burst out in anger because of all he had done in the name of rebellion.[8] In the end, Andor's selflessness[17] and regret for his past actions[8] led to him joining the ragtag Rogue One mission.[17] Meeting Erso and joining that mission helped Andor remember why he became a Rebel agent in the first place.[16] Paying the ultimate sacrifice he could in the apogee of his selfless devotion to the Rebel Alliance[17] and wanting to bring a new hope to the galaxy, Andor willingly gave his life[16] to ensure the Death Star plans were given to those who could use them to win the war."
Ryan Gosling,"A Nexus-9 replicant model, Officer K was inherently obedient and devoted in his duty as a member of law enforcement in Los Angeles. He was predisposed to be truthful and loyal to his superiors."
Ryan Gosling,"Despite his cool and collected demeanor, K could and would demonstrate that he was an experienced, hardened police officer capable of turning aggressive and contentious."
Ryan Gosling,"He thoroughly enjoyed listening to vocal jazz and standards, big band jazz and the like. K also indulged himself with bourbon upon returning from a hard day's work."
Ryan Gosling,"K's investigation pushed him to the limits, both emotionally and physically, yet ultimately he chose to act selflessly and courageously as he rescued Deckard from the Wallace Corporation."
