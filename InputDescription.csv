Jack Black,"Po's (played by Jack Black in the films) main interest lies in Kung Fu. He developed a comprehensive knowledge of the lore of warriors, famous combat moves, dates and historical artifacts. His deep appreciation of the martial arts extends into its philosophical aspects, enabling him sometimes to achieve insights of which even deeply respected masters like Shifu cannot conceive. He was popular with all his friends and they all loved him as a kid. He is an excellent cook but has terrible table manners."
Jack Black,"The original Denham was based on Merian C. Cooper, creator of King Kong;[2] both were brave men of action who made names for themselves filming nature footage in the most dangerous of territories. In some ways, Denham's travels in King Kong match the move that Cooper made when he shifted from documentary filming to narrative storytelling.  While bold and willing to take risks, the original Denham is honest, putting his people in danger but never asking more of them than he does of himself.  In The Son of Kong, he shows great remorse for what he has done and sorrow at the loss of Kong."
Jack Black,"As a film director, Denham had had some success, but he had always been told his films would be even more profitable if he had a woman present in the film.  For that reason, he tries to get an actress to accompany him on his next documentary, but no agent will send him anyone due to the risks involved. Even his usual agent Weston could not supply him with anyone.  Eventually, he discovers Ann Darrow on the streets.  She is at first concerned about Denham's advances, but Denham reassures her that the job will involve no ""funny business""."
Jack Black,"Carl Denham is a fictional character in the films King Kong and The Son of Kong (both released in 1933), as well as in the 2005 remake of King Kong, and a 2004 illustrated novel titled Kong: King of Skull Island.[1]  The role was played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 films and by Jack Black in the 2005 remake. In The Mighty Kong, he was voiced by Dudley Moore. Denham's function in the story is to initiate the action by bringing the characters to Skull Island, where they encounter the giant beast Kong.  Denham then brings Kong to New York City to put him on display as entertainment, but he escapes and rampages through the city.
The less faithful 1976 remake has an analogue character named Fred Wilson, portrayed by Charles Grodin."
